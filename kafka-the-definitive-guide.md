  - **Workflow**: Create a producer, configure properties, construct `ProducerRecord`, send records.

- **Producer Configuration**:
  - **Bootstrap Servers**: Addresses of Kafka brokers.
  - **Key and Value Serializers**: Convert keys and values to byte arrays.
  - **Acknowledgment (acks)**: Determines the level of guarantee for message delivery (e.g., `acks=all` for strongest guarantee).

#### Sending Messages
- **Asynchronous Sends**:
  - **Method**: `send` method to send records asynchronously.
  - **Callback**: Optional callbacks for handling success and failure.

- **Synchronous Sends**:
  - **Method**: `send` method with `get` to block until the message is acknowledged.
  - **Usage**: Typically avoided due to performance impact.

- **Message Batching**:
  - **Purpose**: Improve performance by sending records in batches.
  - **Configuration**: `batch.size` and `linger.ms` properties control batch size and delay.

#### Error Handling and Retries
- **Retry Mechanism**:
  - **Configuration**: `retries` and `retry.backoff.ms` properties.
  - **Idempotence**: Setting `enable.idempotence=true` ensures exactly-once delivery semantics.

- **Error Handling**:
  - **Retries**: Automatically retry on transient errors.
  - **Callback Handling**: Implement custom logic in callbacks to handle errors.

#### Partitions and Keys
- **Partitioning**:
  - **Default Behavior**: Round-robin distribution of messages across partitions.
  - **Custom Partitions**: Implement `Partitioner` interface for custom logic.

- **Message Keys**:
  - **Usage**: Determine the partition for the message.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures messages with the same key are sent to the same partition.

#### Advanced Configuration
- **Compression**:
  - **Types**: `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, and `zstd`.
  - **Benefits**: Reduces network bandwidth and storage requirements.

- **Timeouts**:
  - **Delivery Timeout**: `delivery.timeout.ms` for overall timeout of message delivery.
  - **Request Timeout**: `request.timeout.ms` for individual request timeout.

#### Monitoring and Metrics
- **JMX Metrics**:

#### Polling and Consuming Records
- **Polling Records**:
  - **Method**: `poll` method retrieves records from Kafka.
  - **Looping**: Continuous loop to keep polling and processing records.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    while (true) {
        ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
        for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
            System.out.printf("offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n", record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
        }
    }
    ```

#### Consumer Groups and Partition Rebalancing
- **Consumer Groups**:
  - **Concept**: Multiple consumers in a group share the workload.
  - **Partition Assignment**: Kafka distributes partitions among consumers in a group.

- **Rebalancing**:

  - **Impact**: Consumers temporarily stop processing during rebalancing.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement `ConsumerRebalanceListener` to manage rebalancing.

#### Offset Management
- **Offsets**:
  - **Definition**: Position of a consumer in a partition.
  - **Manual Offset Control**: Explicitly commit offsets using `commitSync` or `commitAsync`.
  - **Auto Commit**: Kafka automatically commits offsets periodically if enabled.

- **Session Timeouts**:
  - **Configuration**: `session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms`.
  - **Purpose**: Manage consumer liveness and rebalancing intervals.

#### Monitoring and Metrics
- **JMX Metrics**:
  - **Monitoring**: Use Java Management Extensions (JMX) to monitor consumer metrics.
  - **Key Metrics**: Fetch rate, lag, commit rate, and error rate.

#### Best Practices
- **Graceful Shutdown**:
  - **Method**: Use `consumer.wakeup` and proper shutdown hooks.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
        consumer.wakeup();
        try {
            consumerThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }));
    ```

    ```

#### Managing Partitions and Replicas
- **Reassigning Partitions**:
  - **Tool**: Use `kafka-reassign-partitions` to move partitions between brokers.
  - **Command Example**:
    ```bash
    kafka-reassign-partitions --zookeeper localhost:2181 --reassignment-json-file reassignment.json --execute
    ```

- **Adding and Removing Brokers**:
  - **Procedure**: Modify the partition reassignment plan to add or remove brokers.

#### Monitoring Kafka
- **Tools**:
  - **JMX**: Java Management Extensions for monitoring Kafka metrics.
  - **Prometheus and Grafana**: For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
  - **Burrow**: A monitoring tool for tracking consumer lag.

- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Broker Metrics**: CPU usage, disk I/O, network throughput.
  - **Topic Metrics**: Number of partitions, replication status, log size.
  - **Consumer Metrics**: Consumer lag, read rate.

#### Handling Failures
- **Broker Failures**:
  - **Detection**: Zookeeper detects and handles broker failures.
  - **Recovery**: Replace the failed broker and use partition reassignment if necessary.

- **Topic and Partition Issues**:
  - **Replication Issues**: Use `kafka-replica-verification` to verify and correct under-replicated partitions.
  - **Data Loss**: Ensure proper replication and backups to mitigate data loss.

#### Backup and Restore
- **Backup Strategies**:
  - **Log Segments**: Regularly back up log segments.
  - **Metadata**: Back up Zookeeper data and Kafka configuration.

- **Restoring Data**:
  - **Procedure**: Restore log segments and metadata to recover the Kafka cluster.

#### Security Administration
- **Setting Up Security**:
  - **SSL/TLS**: Configure brokers and clients for encrypted communication.
  - **SASL**: Set up authentication mechanisms like SASL/PLAIN or SASL/Kerberos.

- **Managing ACLs**:
  - **Creating ACLs**:
    ```bash
    kafka-acls --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Alice --operation Read --topic test
    ```

### Conclusion
- **Summary**: Administering Kafka involves managing brokers, topics, partitions, and monitoring the cluster to ensure high availability and performance. Security and backup strategies are also crucial.
- **Next Steps**: Explore advanced topics and best practices for optimizing Kafka performance and ensuring data integrity in the following chapters.

  - **Scripts**:
    ```bash
    tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.7.0.tgz
    cd kafka_2.13-2.7.0
    ```

- **Configuration Files**:
  - **Server Properties**: Configure `server.properties` for broker settings such as `broker.id`, `log.dirs`, `zookeeper.connect`.
  - **Zookeeper Properties**: Set up `zoo.cfg` for Zookeeper ensemble settings.

#### Cluster Deployment
- **Setting Up Brokers**:
  - **Replication**: Ensure proper replication factor for topics.
  - **Broker Count**: Deploy multiple brokers to handle load and provide fault tolerance.
