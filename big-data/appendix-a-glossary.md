# Appendix A: Glossary

### Overview
- **Purpose**: To provide definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts used throughout the book.
- **Scope**: Covers terminology related to Big Data, data processing frameworks, and the Lambda Architecture.

### Key Terms

#### A-C
- **Aggregation**: The process of summarizing data by grouping and performing computations like sum, average, count, etc.
- **Batch Processing**: Processing large volumes of data at scheduled intervals.
- **Column Family**: A container for rows in a NoSQL database like Cassandra.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring that all nodes in a distributed system have the same data at the same time.

#### D-F
- **Data Lake**: A storage repository that holds vast amounts of raw data in its native format.
- **Data Partitioning**: Dividing a database into pieces that can be spread across multiple servers for load balancing.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a destination system.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability of a system to continue functioning in the event of a failure.

#### G-I
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware and handle large datasets.
- **Idempotency**: Property ensuring that an operation can be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
- **Indexing**: Creating a data structure to improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

#### J-L
- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- **Latency**: The delay before data begins to be processed.
- **Lambda Architecture**: A data processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data by using both batch and real-time processing methods.

#### M-O
- **MapReduce**: A programming model used for processing large datasets with a distributed algorithm on a cluster.
- **Node**: A single machine in a distributed system.
- **Operational Data Store (ODS)**: A database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data.

#### P-R
- **Partitioner**: In Hadoop, it determines which reducer a particular input key-value pair is sent to.
- **Query Latency**: The time it takes to execute a query and return the results.
- **Replication**: Storing copies of data on multiple nodes to ensure availability and fault tolerance.

#### S-U
- **Schema-on-Read**: Defining the schema of data as it is read rather than when it is written.
- **Spout**: In Apache Storm, a source of streams.
- **Stream Processing**: Processing data in real-time as it flows in.
- **Tuple**: A single entry or row in a database table or a single data record in a stream.

#### V-Z
- **Volume**: The amount of data.
- **Velocity**: The speed at which data is processed.
- **Variety**: The different types of data (structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
- **Zookeeper**: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

### Summary
- **Key Takeaways**: The glossary provides concise definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts essential for understanding Big Data systems, data processing frameworks, and the Lambda Architecture. Familiarity with these terms is crucial for anyone working with Big Data technologies.

These detailed notes provide a comprehensive overview of Appendix A, covering the glossary of key terms as presented in "Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Real-Time Data Systems" by Nathan Marz and James Warren.
