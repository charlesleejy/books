- **Data Types**:
  - Use appropriate data types for each column to optimize storage and performance.
  - Examples: INTEGER for whole numbers, DECIMAL for precise numerical values, VARCHAR for strings.

### 6.2 Indexing Strategies
- **Purpose**: Improve query performance by enabling faster data retrieval.
- **Types of Indexes**:
  - **Primary Index**: Unique identifier for each row, usually on the primary key.
  - **Secondary Index**: Additional indexes on frequently queried columns to improve access speed.

- **Considerations**:
  - Balance between read and write performance. Excessive indexing can slow down data loading and updates.
  - Use bitmap indexes for columns with low cardinality and high query frequency.

### 6.3 Partitioning Strategies
- **Purpose**: Enhance query performance and manageability by dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Types of Partitioning**:
  - **Range Partitioning**: Divides data based on a range of values (e.g., date ranges).
  - **List Partitioning**: Divides data based on a list of discrete values (e.g., regions).
  - **Hash Partitioning**: Divides data based on a hash function, distributing rows evenly across partitions.

- **Benefits**:
  - Improves query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
  - Facilitates data management tasks such as backups, archiving, and purging.

### 6.4 Performance Optimization
- **Query Optimization**:
  - Use query execution plans to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
  - Optimize SQL queries by rewriting them for efficiency and ensuring proper use of indexes.

- **Materialized Views**:
  - Precomputed views that store the results of complex queries.
  - Improve performance for frequent, resource-intensive queries by avoiding repeated calculations.

- **Denormalization**:
  - Reducing the level of normalization to improve read performance.
  - Carefully balance between data redundancy and performance gains.

### 6.5 Data Loading Techniques
- **Batch Loading**:
  - Load data in bulk at scheduled intervals (e.g., nightly batches).
  - Use database utilities and ETL tools for efficient bulk loading.

- **Incremental Loading**:
  - Load only the new or changed data since the last load.
  - Techniques: Change Data Capture (CDC), timestamps, version numbers.

- **Real-Time Loading**:
  - Continuously load data as it is generated or received.
  - Use streaming technologies and frameworks such as Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub.

### 6.6 Data Quality and Integrity
