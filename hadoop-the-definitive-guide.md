     - `IntWritable`, `LongWritable`, `Text`, `NullWritable`.
   - **Custom Writable Types**:
     - Creating custom writable types involves implementing the `Writable` interface.
       ```java
       public class MyWritable implements Writable {
           private int counter;
           private long timestamp;

           public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
               out.writeInt(counter);
               out.writeLong(timestamp);
           }

           public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException {
               counter = in.readInt();
               timestamp = in.readLong();
           }
       }
       ```

### Detailed Notes on Chapter 6: How MapReduce Works
**"Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 6 delves into the inner workings of the MapReduce framework in Hadoop. It explains the detailed execution process of a MapReduce job, including the stages and mechanisms involved. Understanding how MapReduce works is crucial for optimizing performance and troubleshooting issues in Hadoop applications.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Anatomy of a MapReduce Job Run**
   - **Job Submission**:
     - The `Job` class is used to configure and submit a job.
     - Job submission involves creating an instance of `JobClient` which submits the job and monitors its progress.
     - Example:
       ```java
       Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, "example job");
       job.setJarByClass(MyJob.class);
       job.setMapperClass(MyMapper.class);
       job.setReducerClass(MyReducer.class);
       job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
       job.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);
       FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0]));
       FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));
       job.waitForCompletion(true);
       ```
   
   - **Job Initialization**:
     - The job client initializes the job by determining the input splits, which define the portions of the input data to be processed by individual map tasks.
     - The job is then handed over to the `JobTracker`.

   - **Task Assignment**:
     - The `JobTracker` assigns map and reduce tasks to `TaskTrackers` based on data locality and resource availability.
     - The `TaskTracker` manages task execution on individual nodes.

2. **Job Execution Workflow**
   - **Map Task**:
     - Each map task processes an input split, converts the input data into key-value pairs, and passes them to the map function.
     - Intermediate key-value pairs are stored in an in-memory buffer, which periodically spills to disk.

   - **Shuffle and Sort**:
     - After the map phase, the framework sorts and transfers the map output to the reduce tasks.
     - Data is partitioned by key and shuffled across the network to the nodes running the reduce tasks.

   - **Reduce Task**:
     - Each reduce task processes the sorted key-value pairs.
     - The reduce function is called for each unique key, and the output is written to HDFS.

3. **Failures and Speculative Execution**
   - **Handling Failures**:
     - MapReduce is designed to handle hardware and software failures gracefully.
     - If a task fails, it is retried a certain number of times before being marked as failed.
     - The framework may rerun the job from the last successful checkpoint.

   - **Speculative Execution**:
     - Speculative execution helps improve job performance by running backup tasks for slow-running tasks.
     - The first task to complete successfully is used, and the other tasks are killed.

4. **Job Scheduling**
   - **Default FIFO Scheduler**:
     - The default scheduling mechanism in Hadoop is FIFO (First In, First Out).
     - Jobs are scheduled in the order they are submitted.

   - **Fair Scheduler**:
     - The Fair Scheduler allocates resources to jobs such that all jobs get, on average, an equal share of resources over time.
     - Supports job pools for resource allocation based on priorities.

   - **Capacity Scheduler**:
     - The Capacity Scheduler allows for the sharing of large clusters while providing job capacity guarantees.
     - It is designed to maximize resource utilization and throughput.

5. **Shuffle and Sort**
   - **Map Side**:
     - The output of the map phase is written to a circular memory buffer.
     - When the buffer reaches a threshold, it is spilled to disk and partitioned by reducer.
     - The partitions are sorted and combined into a single file per partition.

   - **Reduce Side**:
     - The reduce task fetches its partitioned data from the map tasks.
     - The data is merged and sorted before being passed to the reduce function.

6. **Task Execution**
   - **Task Lifecycle**:
     - Each task runs in its own JVM.
     - Initialization includes setting up the environment, reading input splits, and running the user-defined map or reduce function.
     - Finalization involves writing the output and reporting status to the `TaskTracker`.

   - **Output Committers**:
     - The output committer coordinates the transition from temporary task output to the final committed output.
     - Ensures that output is committed atomically and consistently.

### **Summary**
Chapter 6 of "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" provides an in-depth understanding of the MapReduce framework's inner workings. It covers the complete execution process of a MapReduce job, including job submission, initialization, task assignment, and execution. The chapter also explains how Hadoop handles failures and speculative execution, as well as different job scheduling mechanisms. Additionally, it delves into the shuffle and sort phases and the lifecycle of task execution. This detailed knowledge is essential for optimizing and troubleshooting Hadoop MapReduce jobs effectively.

### Detailed Notes on Chapter 8: MapReduce Features
**"Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 8 explores advanced features of the MapReduce framework in Hadoop. It covers a range of functionalities including counters, sorting, joins, and side data distribution. These features enhance the capabilities of MapReduce, allowing for more sophisticated data processing and analysis.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Counters**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Counters are used to count occurrences of events within a MapReduce job, useful for reporting and debugging.
   - **Types of Counters**:
     - Built-in counters: Provided by Hadoop to track basic job statistics (e.g., number of map/reduce tasks, input/output records).
     - User-defined counters: Custom counters created by developers to track specific events or conditions.
   - **Using Counters**:
     - Define and increment a counter:
       ```java
       enum MyCounters { RECORDS_PROCESSED }
       context.getCounter(MyCounters.RECORDS_PROCESSED).increment(1);
       ```
   - **Accessing Counters**:
     - Counters can be accessed through the Job object after job completion:
       ```java
       Counter counter = job.getCounters().findCounter(MyCounters.RECORDS_PROCESSED);
       System.out.println("Records Processed: " + counter.getValue());
       ```

2. **Sorting**
   - **Total Order Sorting**:
     - Ensures that the output of a MapReduce job is globally sorted.
     - **TotalOrderPartitioner**: Used to partition data in such a way that it produces a globally sorted output.
     - Requires sampling input data to create a partition file.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     job.setPartitionerClass(TotalOrderPartitioner.class);
     TotalOrderPartitioner.setPartitionFile(conf, partitionFile);
     ```

3. **Joins**
   - **Types of Joins**:
     - **Reduce-Side Join**: Joins performed in the reduce phase, where mappers tag records with their source and reducers perform the join.
     - **Map-Side Join**: Joins performed in the map phase, efficient for large datasets with a common sort order.
     - **Map-Side Join with a Distributed Cache**: Used when one dataset is small enough to fit in memory and can be distributed to all nodes.
   - **Reduce-Side Join Example**:
     ```java
     public class ReduceJoinReducer extends Reducer<Text, Text, Text, Text> {
         public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<Text> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
             // Perform join logic here
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Side Data Distribution**
   - **Distributed Cache**:
     - A mechanism to distribute read-only data needed by the tasks.
     - Useful for small datasets that can be efficiently distributed to all nodes.
     - Adding files to the distributed cache:
       ```java
       job.addCacheFile(new URI("/path/to/cache/file#alias"));
       ```
     - Accessing distributed cache files:
       ```java
       Path[] cacheFiles = context.getLocalCacheFiles();
       ```
   - **Using the Distributed Cache**:
     - Example:
       ```java
       public class DistributedCacheMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
           private Map<String, String> cacheMap = new HashMap<>();

           protected void setup(Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
               Path[] cacheFiles = context.getLocalCacheFiles();
               if (cacheFiles != null && cacheFiles.length > 0) {
                   // Load cache file into memory
               }
           }

           public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
               // Use cacheMap in the map logic
           }
       }
       ```

5. **Bloom Filters**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
     - Efficient for scenarios where the exact membership is not required.
   - **Using Bloom Filters**:
     - Creating and using a Bloom filter:
       ```java
       BloomFilter filter = new BloomFilter(numElements, numHashes, Hash.MURMUR_HASH);
       filter.add(new Key("element"));
       boolean result = filter.membershipTest(new Key("element"));
       ```

6. **Data Skew**
   - **Definition**:
     - Imbalance in data distribution causing uneven load across tasks.
   - **Handling Data Skew**:
     - Techniques include using a custom partitioner, sampling the data, or preprocessing to balance the load.

### **Summary**
Chapter 8 of "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" provides an in-depth look at advanced MapReduce features that enhance the framework's capabilities. It covers the use of counters for tracking job metrics, sorting mechanisms for globally sorted outputs, and various join strategies for combining datasets. The chapter also introduces side data distribution using the distributed cache, the use of Bloom filters for efficient membership testing, and techniques for handling data skew. Understanding these features allows developers to create more sophisticated and efficient MapReduce applications, capable of handling complex data processing tasks in Hadoop.

   - **Execution Modes**:
     - **Local Mode**: Runs Pig on a single machine without Hadoop.
     - **MapReduce Mode**: Runs Pig on a Hadoop cluster.
     - Setting the execution mode:
       ```sh
       pig -x local
       pig -x mapreduce
       ```

3. **Pig Latin Basics**
   - **Data Model**:
     - Pig's data model includes atoms, tuples, bags, and maps.
   - **Loading Data**:
     - Use the `LOAD` statement to read data from HDFS or local file system.
       ```sh
       A = LOAD 'input.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (field1:int, field2:chararray);
       ```
   - **Storing Data**:
     - Use the `STORE` statement to write data to HDFS or local file system.
       ```sh
       STORE A INTO 'output' USING PigStorage(',');
       ```

4. **Pig Latin Operators**
   - **Filtering Data**:
     - Use the `FILTER` statement to select records based on a condition.
       ```sh
       B = FILTER A BY field1 > 10;
       ```
   - **Grouping and Aggregating**:
     - Use the `GROUP` and `FOREACH` statements to group data and perform aggregations.
       ```sh
       C = GROUP A BY field2;
       D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, COUNT(A);
       ```
   - **Joining Data**:
     - Use the `JOIN` statement to join two or more datasets.
       ```sh
       E = JOIN A BY field1, B BY field2;
       ```
   - **Sorting Data**:

     - Use the `UNION` statement to combine multiple datasets.
       ```sh
       G = UNION A, B;
       ```

5. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Extend Pig’s functionality by writing custom functions in Java, Python, or other languages supported by the JVM.
   - **Creating a UDF**:
     - Example of a simple UDF in Java:
       ```java
       import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
       import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;

       public class MyUDF extends EvalFunc<String> {
           public String exec(Tuple input) throws IOException {
               if (input == null || input.size() == 0)
                   return null;
               return ((String) input.get(0)).toUpperCase();
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Registering and Using UDFs**:
     - Register and invoke a UDF in Pig Latin.
       ```sh
       REGISTER myudf.jar;
       DEFINE MyUDF com.example.MyUDF();
       H = FOREACH A GENERATE MyUDF(field2);
       ```

6. **Control Flow**
   - **Control Statements**:
     - Use `IF`, `CASE`, and other control statements to manage the flow of execution.
       ```sh
       I = FOREACH A GENERATE (field1 > 10 ? 'high' : 'low') AS category;
       ```

7. **Optimization**
   - **Execution Plans**:
     - Pig optimizes execution plans for efficiency, but understanding the plans can help in writing more performant scripts.
     - View the execution plan using `EXPLAIN`.
       ```sh
       EXPLAIN A;
       ```
   - **Tips for Optimization**:
     - Use built-in functions and operators efficiently.
     - Minimize the number of data transformations.
     - Utilize UDFs judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks.

8. **Running Pig in Production**
   - **Parameter Substitution**:
     - Use parameter substitution to make scripts more flexible and reusable.
       ```sh
       pig -param input=/data/input.txt script.pig
       ```
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Implement error handling mechanisms to manage and log errors effectively.

9. **Integration with Other Hadoop Ecosystem Components**
   - **Hive Integration**:
     - Query Hive tables using Pig.

       ```
     - Create a table:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE mytable (id INT, name STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
       ```
   - **Loading Data**:
     - Load data into a table:
       ```sql
       LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/data' INTO TABLE mytable;
       ```
   - **Querying Data**:
     - Simple query:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM mytable;
       ```

5. **Hive Data Types**
   - **Primitive Types**:
     - Examples include `INT`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, `BOOLEAN`.
   - **Complex Types**:
     - **ARRAY**: Ordered collection of elements.
     - **MAP**: Collection of key-value pairs.
     - **STRUCT**: Group of named fields.

6. **Data Formats**

           public Text evaluate(Text input) {
               if (input == null) return null;
               return new Text(input.toString().toUpperCase());
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Registering and Using UDFs**:
     - Register and invoke a UDF in HiveQL.
       ```sql
       ADD JAR /path/to/myudf.jar;
       CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION myudf AS 'com.example.MyUDF';
       SELECT myudf(name) FROM mytable;
       ```

10. **Optimizing Hive Queries**
    - **Indexes**:
      - Create indexes to speed up query performance:
        ```sql
        CREATE INDEX idx_name ON TABLE mytable (name) AS 'COMPACT' WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
        ALTER INDEX idx_name ON mytable REBUILD;
        ```
    - **Query Optimization**:
      - Use EXPLAIN to understand the execution plan of a query:
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM mytable;
        ```
    - **Best Practices**:
      - Partitioning and bucketing for large datasets.
      - Using efficient file formats like ORC for storage.
      - Optimizing join operations by reducing the number of MapReduce jobs.

11. **Hive Integration with Other Tools**

           public UppercaseFunction(Fields fieldDeclaration) {
               super(fieldDeclaration);
           }

           @Override
           public void operate(FlowProcess flowProcess, FunctionCall<NullContext> functionCall) {
               TupleEntry argument = functionCall.getArguments();
               String line = argument.getString(0).toUpperCase();
               functionCall.getOutputCollector().add(new Tuple(line));
           }
       }
       ```
     - Use the custom function in a pipe:
