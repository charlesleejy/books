       CREATE TABLE transformed_sales AS
       SELECT region, product, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY region, product;
       ```
   - **Stored Procedures**:
     - Implement complex procedural logic using JavaScript-based stored procedures.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE PROCEDURE process_sales()
       RETURNS STRING
       LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
       EXECUTE AS CALLER
       AS
       $$
       var sql_command = "INSERT INTO transformed_sales SELECT region, product, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY region, product;";
       snowflake.execute(sql_command);
       return 'Success';
       $$;
       ```
   - **Tasks and Streams**:
     - Automate data transformation processes using tasks and streams.
     - Example:
