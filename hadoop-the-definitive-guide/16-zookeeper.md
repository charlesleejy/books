### Detailed Notes on Chapter 16: ZooKeeper
**"Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 16 explores Apache ZooKeeper, a coordination service for distributed applications. It explains the architecture, use cases, and integration of ZooKeeper with Hadoop, along with practical examples and best practices.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Introduction to ZooKeeper**
   - **Purpose**:
     - ZooKeeper is designed to provide coordination services for distributed applications, such as configuration management, synchronization, and naming.
   - **Features**:
     - High availability, strong consistency, and ordered updates.

2. **ZooKeeper Architecture**
   - **Components**:
     - **ZooKeeper Ensemble**: A group of ZooKeeper servers (typically odd-numbered) to ensure high availability.
     - **Leader**: The server responsible for processing all write requests.
     - **Followers**: Servers that replicate the leader’s state and handle read requests.
     - **Observers**: Non-voting members that receive updates from the leader and serve read requests.
   - **Data Model**:
     - Hierarchical namespace similar to a file system, with znodes representing nodes in the hierarchy.
     - Znodes can store data and have an associated ACL (Access Control List).

3. **Installing and Running ZooKeeper**
   - **Installation**:
     - Download ZooKeeper from the Apache ZooKeeper website.
     - Unpack the distribution and set up configuration files.
   - **Configuration Files**:
     - **zoo.cfg**: Main configuration file.
     - Example configuration:
       ```properties
       tickTime=2000
       dataDir=/var/zookeeper
       clientPort=2181
       initLimit=5
       syncLimit=2
       server.1=zk1:2888:3888
       server.2=zk2:2888:3888
       server.3=zk3:2888:3888
       ```
   - **Starting ZooKeeper**:
     - Start ZooKeeper using the start script:
       ```sh
       bin/zkServer.sh start
       ```
   - **ZooKeeper CLI**:
     - Interactive command-line interface for interacting with ZooKeeper:
       ```sh
       bin/zkCli.sh -server localhost:2181
       ```

4. **ZooKeeper Data Model**
   - **Znodes**:
     - **Persistent Znodes**: Remain in ZooKeeper until explicitly deleted.
     - **Ephemeral Znodes**: Exist as long as the session that created them is active.
   - **Data Access**:
     - Create a znode:
       ```sh
       create /myznode mydata
       ```
     - Read a znode:
       ```sh
       get /myznode
       ```
     - Set data for a znode:
       ```sh
       set /myznode newdata
       ```
     - Delete a znode:
       ```sh
       delete /myznode
       ```

5. **ZooKeeper Watches**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Watches are a mechanism to get notifications of changes to znodes.
   - **Setting Watches**:
     - Set a watch on a znode:
       ```sh
       get /myznode watch
       ```
   - **Notifications**:
     - Clients receive notifications when the znode’s data or children change.

6. **ZooKeeper Sessions**
   - **Sessions**:
     - Created when a client connects to a ZooKeeper server.
     - Maintain a session ID and timeout.
   - **Ephemeral Nodes**:
     - Automatically deleted when the session that created them ends.

7. **ZooKeeper Use Cases**
   - **Configuration Management**:
     - Store and manage configuration information.
     - Example: Centralized configuration for distributed applications.
   - **Synchronization**:
     - Coordinate and synchronize distributed processes.
     - Example: Distributed locks and leader election.
   - **Naming Service**:
     - Provide a unique naming scheme for distributed resources.
     - Example: Assign unique IDs to resources in a cluster.

8. **Programming with ZooKeeper**
   - **Java API**:
     - Interact with ZooKeeper programmatically using the Java API.
   - **Creating a Connection**:
     - Establish a connection to the ZooKeeper ensemble:
       ```java
       ZooKeeper zk = new ZooKeeper("localhost:2181", 3000, null);
       ```
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - Create a znode:
       ```java
       zk.create("/myznode", "mydata".getBytes(), ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
       ```
     - Read a znode:
       ```java
       byte[] data = zk.getData("/myznode", false, null);
       ```
     - Update a znode:
       ```java
       zk.setData("/myznode", "newdata".getBytes(), -1);
       ```
     - Delete a znode:
       ```java
       zk.delete("/myznode", -1);
       ```

9. **ZooKeeper Recipes**
   - **Distributed Lock**:
     - Implement a distributed lock using ZooKeeper.
   - **Leader Election**:
     - Implement leader election for distributed systems.
   - **Barrier**:
     - Implement a barrier to synchronize processes at a certain point.

10. **ZooKeeper Administration**
    - **Monitoring**:
      - Monitor ZooKeeper using built-in four-letter commands (`stat`, `mntr`, `conf`).
    - **Maintenance**:
      - Perform regular backups of ZooKeeper data and transaction logs.
    - **Security**:
      - Enable Kerberos for authentication and configure ACLs for access control.
    - **Scaling ZooKeeper**:
      - Add more nodes to the ensemble for higher availability and reliability.

### **Summary**

It covers ZooKeeper’s architecture, including its components (Leader, Followers, Observers), and its hierarchical data model with znodes. The chapter explains how to install and configure ZooKeeper, interact with it using the CLI and Java API, and implement common use cases such as configuration management, synchronization, and naming services. It also details advanced features like watches, sessions, and ephemeral nodes. Practical examples and recipes for distributed locks, leader election, and barriers are provided, along with best practices for monitoring, maintenance, security, and scaling ZooKeeper. This knowledge equips readers with the tools needed to effectively use ZooKeeper for managing and coordinating distributed applications.
