   - **Data Catalogs**: Centralized repositories that provide metadata and data lineage information.

4. **Roles in Data Governance**:
   - **Data Owners**: Individuals responsible for specific datasets.
   - **Data Stewards**: Responsible for maintaining data quality and implementing governance policies.
   - **Data Custodians**: IT professionals who manage the technical aspects of data storage and security.

5. **Data Governance Processes**:
   - **Policy Development**: Creating and maintaining data policies and standards.
   - **Data Classification**: Categorizing data based on its sensitivity and importance.
   - **Access Management**: Controlling who can access and modify data.
   - **Auditing and Reporting**: Regularly reviewing data practices and reporting compliance and quality metrics.

6. **Tools for Data Governance**:
   - **Data Cataloging Tools**: Alation, Collibra, Apache Atlas.
