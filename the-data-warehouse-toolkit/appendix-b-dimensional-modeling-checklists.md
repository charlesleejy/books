# Appendix B: Dimensional Modeling Checklists

### Overview
- **Purpose**: To provide comprehensive checklists that ensure the completeness and correctness of dimensional models in a data warehouse.
- **Scope**: Includes checklists for designing fact tables, dimension tables, and ensuring data quality and performance.

### Fact Table Checklist
1. **Grain Definition**:
   - Clearly define the grain of the fact table.
   - Ensure each row in the fact table represents the same level of detail.

2. **Measures**:
   - Identify and list all measures to be included.
   - Ensure measures are additive where appropriate.
   - Include derived measures if needed.

3. **Foreign Keys**:
   - Ensure every dimension related to the fact table is represented by a foreign key.
   - Verify that foreign keys link correctly to the corresponding dimension tables.

4. **Aggregations**:
   - Plan for necessary aggregate fact tables to improve query performance.
   - Define the level of aggregation for each aggregate table.

5. **Surrogate Keys**:
   - Use surrogate keys for all foreign keys instead of natural keys.
   - Ensure surrogate keys are unique and consistent across the data warehouse.

6. **Fact Table Size**:
   - Estimate the size of the fact table in terms of rows and storage.
   - Plan for partitioning if the table size is very large.

7. **Date and Time**:
   - Include a date dimension key to link with the date dimension.
   - If necessary, include a time dimension key for more granular time analysis.

### Dimension Table Checklist
1. **Attribute Completeness**:
   - Identify and list all attributes for each dimension.
   - Ensure attributes are descriptive and support user queries.

2. **Hierarchies**:
   - Define hierarchies within dimensions (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month > Day).
   - Ensure hierarchies support drill-down and roll-up analysis.

3. **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**:
   - Decide on the appropriate SCD type (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) for each attribute.
   - Implement mechanisms to handle changes according to the chosen SCD type.

4. **Surrogate Keys**:
   - Use surrogate keys as primary keys for dimension tables.
   - Ensure surrogate keys are unique and consistent.

5. **Consistency and Conformity**:
   - Ensure conformed dimensions are consistent across different fact tables.
   - Verify that attribute definitions are standardized.

6. **Data Quality**:
   - Implement validation rules to ensure data quality (e.g., uniqueness, completeness).
   - Plan for regular data quality checks and audits.

7. **Attribute Datatypes**:
   - Choose appropriate datatypes for each attribute.
   - Ensure datatypes support efficient storage and querying.

### Data Quality Checklist
1. **Validation Rules**:
   - Define validation rules for data integrity (e.g., primary key uniqueness, foreign key integrity).
   - Implement validation checks during ETL processes.

2. **Data Cleansing**:
   - Plan for data cleansing steps to handle missing, duplicate, or incorrect data.
   - Use data profiling tools to identify data quality issues.

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensure data is consistent across different sources and systems.
   - Implement checks to detect and resolve data inconsistencies.

4. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Set up monitoring tools to track data quality metrics.
   - Perform regular data audits to identify and address data quality issues.

### Performance Checklist
1. **Indexing**:
   - Identify columns that need indexing to improve query performance.
   - Regularly maintain indexes (e.g., rebuilding, reorganizing).

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Plan for partitioning large tables to improve performance and manageability.
   - Define partitioning keys and strategies (e.g., range partitioning, list partitioning).

3. **Aggregations**:
   - Precompute necessary aggregates to reduce query time.
   - Define aggregate tables at appropriate levels of granularity.

4. **Materialized Views**:
   - Use materialized views for complex and frequently accessed queries.
   - Define refresh strategies for materialized views (e.g., on-demand, scheduled).

5. **Query Optimization**:
   - Review and optimize query execution plans.
   - Implement query tuning techniques to improve performance.

6. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, I/O) and plan for scalability.
   - Ensure the infrastructure supports the expected workload.

### Summary
- **Purpose**: The checklists serve as a comprehensive guide to ensure the design, implementation, and maintenance of dimensional models are thorough and effective.
- **Scope**: Covers essential aspects of fact tables, dimension tables, data quality, and performance.
