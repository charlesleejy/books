  - **Timeliness**: Availability of up-to-date data for decision-making.

### 19.9 Case Study: Educational Institution Data Warehouse Implementation
- **Background**: A university needs to integrate data from various sources to improve student performance tracking, course management, and operational efficiency.
- **Challenges**:
  - Integrating data from multiple sources such as student information systems (SIS), learning management systems (LMS), and human resources (HR) systems.
  - Ensuring data quality and compliance with FERPA regulations.
  - Providing real-time access to student and course data for faculty and administrators.

- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Data Integration**: Used ETL processes to extract, transform, and load data from SIS, LMS, and HR systems into the data warehouse.
  - **Data Modeling**:
    - Designed a student-centric data model with a central Student Dimension.
    - Created fact tables for enrollments and class schedules.
    - Developed dimensions for courses, terms, and faculty.
