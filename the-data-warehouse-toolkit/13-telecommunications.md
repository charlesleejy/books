- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Call Type Key**: Surrogate key.
  - **Call Type**: Description of the call type (e.g., local, long-distance, international).
  - **Call Category**: Higher-level classification of the call type (e.g., voice, data, SMS).

### 13.4 Location Dimension
- **Definition**: Contains descriptive information about geographic locations.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Location Key**: Surrogate key.
  - **Location Name**: Name of the location.
  - **Location Type**: Type of location (e.g., cell tower, office).
  - **Location Address**: Geographic details including address, city, state, and postal code.
  - **Region**: Larger geographic classification, such as region or market.

### 13.5 Network Dimension
- **Definition**: Contains descriptive information about the network infrastructure.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Network Key**: Surrogate key.
  - **Network Name**: Name of the network.
  - **Network Type**: Type of network (e.g., GSM, CDMA, LTE).

  - **Time Key**: Surrogate key.
  - **Date**: Full date of the call.
  - **Day of Week**: Day of the week.
  - **Month**: Month of the call.
  - **Quarter**: Quarter in which the call occurred.
  - **Year**: Year of the call.
  - **Fiscal Period**: Fiscal period for financial reporting.
  - **Hour**: Hour of the call.
  - **Minute**: Minute of the call.

### 13.7 Handling Changing Dimensions
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**:
  - **Type 1**: Overwrite old data with new data (e.g., updating subscriber contact information).
  - **Type 2**: Add a new row for each change, preserving historical data (e.g., tracking changes in subscriber status).
  - **Type 3**: Add a new column to capture the change (e.g., tracking previous and current network types).

### 13.8 Telecommunications Metrics and Analysis
- **Purpose**: To provide insights into telecommunications operations, call patterns, and financial performance.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Average Call Duration**: Average length of calls over a specific period.
  - **Revenue per Call**: Average revenue generated per call.
  - **Call Drop Rate**: Percentage of calls that are disconnected prematurely.
  - **Network Utilization**: Measure of network capacity usage.
  - **Subscriber Churn Rate**: Percentage of subscribers who cancel their service over a specific period.

### 13.9 Case Study: Telecommunications Data Warehouse
- **Background**: A telecommunications company needs to manage and analyze its call detail records, subscriber information, and network performance to improve operations and customer service.
- **Requirements Gathering**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Network managers, customer service representatives, finance team, marketing team.
  - **Key Questions**:
    - What telecommunications metrics are critical for decision-making?
    - How are call details, subscriber information, and network data tracked?
    - What dimensions are necessary for detailed analysis?

- **Findings**:
  - **Metrics**: Call duration, call cost, call revenue, average call duration, revenue per call, network utilization.
  - **Dimensions**: Time, Subscriber, Call Type, Location, Network.

- **Dimensional Model Design**:
  - **Fact Tables**: Call detail records (CDR) fact table.
  - **Dimensions**: Time, Subscriber, Call Type, Location, Network.
  - **Grain**: Detailed records for each individual call.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Call Detail Records (CDR) Fact Table**: Captures detailed information about each telephone call.
  - **Subscriber Dimension**: Includes attributes such as subscriber name, type, status, and address.
  - **Call Type Dimension**: Includes attributes such as call type and category.
  - **Location Dimension**: Includes attributes such as location name, type, and address.
  - **Network Dimension**: Includes attributes such as network name, type, and operator.
  - **Time Dimension**: Captures daily, monthly, and yearly time attributes.

- **Outcome**:
