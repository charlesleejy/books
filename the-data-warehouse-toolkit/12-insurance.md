  - **Payment Method**: Description of the payment method (e.g., credit card, bank transfer, cash).

### 12.7 Handling Changing Dimensions
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**:
  - **Type 1**: Overwrite old data with new data (e.g., updating adjuster contact information).
  - **Type 2**: Add a new row for each change, preserving historical data (e.g., tracking changes in policy status).
  - **Type 3**: Add a new column to capture the change (e.g., tracking previous and current claim types).

### 12.8 Insurance Metrics and Analysis
- **Purpose**: To provide insights into insurance operations, claims processing, and financial performance.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Loss Ratio**: Ratio of claims paid to premiums earned.
  - **Claims Frequency**: Number of claims filed over a specific period.
  - **Claims Severity**: Average cost per claim.
  - **Customer Retention Rate**: Percentage of policyholders who renew their policies.
  - **Premium Growth Rate**: Rate of increase in premiums over time.

### 12.9 Case Study: Insurance Data Warehouse
- **Background**: An insurance company needs to manage and analyze its policies, claims, and premiums to improve operations and customer service.
- **Requirements Gathering**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Claims managers, underwriters, finance team, customer service representatives.
  - **Key Questions**:
    - What insurance metrics are critical for decision-making?
    - How are policy, claim, and premium data tracked?
    - What dimensions are necessary for detailed analysis?

- **Findings**:
  - **Metrics**: Claim amounts, premium amounts, loss ratio, claims frequency, customer retention rate.
  - **Dimensions**: Time, Policy, Claim Type, Adjuster, Payment Method.

- **Dimensional Model Design**:
  - **Fact Tables**: Claims fact table, premiums fact table.
  - **Dimensions**: Time, Policy, Claim Type, Adjuster, Payment Method.
  - **Grain**: Detailed transactions for claims and premium payments.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Claims Fact Table**: Captures detailed information about insurance claims.
  - **Premiums Fact Table**: Captures detailed information about premium payments.
  - **Policy Dimension**: Includes attributes such as policy number, type, status, and premium amount.
