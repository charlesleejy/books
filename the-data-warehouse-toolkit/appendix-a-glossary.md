# Appendix A: Glossary

### Overview
- **Purpose**: To provide clear definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts used throughout "The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling" by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross.
- **Scope**: Includes terms related to data warehousing, dimensional modeling, ETL processes, and related technologies.

### Key Terms and Definitions

1. **Attribute**
   - **Definition**: A property or characteristic of a dimension table in a dimensional model.
   - **Example**: In a Customer Dimension, attributes might include Customer Name, Address, and Email.

2. **Business Process**
   - **Definition**: A collection of related activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product for customers.
   - **Example**: Sales, inventory management, and order processing are all examples of business processes.

3. **Conformed Dimension**
   - **Definition**: A dimension that is shared across multiple fact tables or data marts, ensuring consistency and integration within the data warehouse.
   - **Example**: A Time Dimension used in both sales and inventory fact tables.

4. **Data Mart**
   - **Definition**: A subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular area, department, or subject.
   - **Example**: A sales data mart or a finance data mart.

5. **Data Warehouse**
   - **Definition**: A centralized repository that stores data from multiple sources, optimized for querying and analysis.
   - **Example**: An enterprise data warehouse that consolidates data from sales, finance, and HR systems.

6. **Dimension**
   - **Definition**: A structure that categorizes facts and measures to enable users to answer business questions.
   - **Example**: Product, Time, and Customer are common dimensions in a data warehouse.

7. **Dimensional Model**
   - **Definition**: A data modeling technique used for designing data warehouses, consisting of fact and dimension tables.
   - **Example**: A star schema or snowflake schema.

8. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
   - **Definition**: The process of extracting data from source systems, transforming it to fit operational needs, and loading it into a data warehouse.
   - **Example**: Extracting sales data from a CRM system, transforming it to ensure consistency, and loading it into a sales data mart.

9. **Fact**
   - **Definition**: A measurable event or transaction in a data warehouse.
   - **Example**: Sales amount, order quantity, and profit are facts in a sales fact table.

10. **Fact Table**
    - **Definition**: A central table in a dimensional model that contains quantitative data for analysis.
    - **Example**: A sales fact table containing measures such as sales amount and order quantity.

11. **Granularity**
    - **Definition**: The level of detail or fineness of data stored in a fact table.
    - **Example**: Daily sales transactions have a finer granularity than monthly sales summaries.

12. **Hierarchy**
    - **Definition**: A logical structure that organizes dimension attributes into levels of detail.
    - **Example**: A Time Dimension hierarchy might include levels such as Year, Quarter, Month, and Day.

13. **Index**
    - **Definition**: A database structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations.
    - **Example**: Indexing the Customer ID column in a Customer Dimension to speed up queries.

14. **Measure**
    - **Definition**: A quantitative value used for analysis, stored in a fact table.
    - **Example**: Revenue, profit, and units sold are measures.

15. **Metadata**
    - **Definition**: Data that describes other data, providing context and meaning.
    - **Example**: Metadata for a sales fact table might include descriptions of columns, data types, and relationships to other tables.

16. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**
    - **Definition**: A category of software tools that provide analysis of data stored in a database.
    - **Example**: OLAP tools allow users to perform complex queries and analysis on data stored in a data warehouse.

17. **Schema**
    - **Definition**: The structure or blueprint of a database, defining tables, columns, relationships, and other elements.
    - **Example**: A star schema with a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables.

18. **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)**
    - **Definition**: A technique for managing changes in dimension data over time.
    - **Example**: Tracking changes in a Customer Dimension when a customer's address changes.

    - **Types**:
      - **Type 1**: Overwrites old data with new data.
      - **Type 2**: Adds a new row for each change, preserving historical data.
      - **Type 3**: Adds a new column to capture the change.

19. **Snowflake Schema**
    - **Definition**: A variation of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.
    - **Example**: A Product Dimension split into Product, Product Category, and Product Supplier tables.

20. **Star Schema**
    - **Definition**: A type of database schema with a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
    - **Example**: A sales star schema with a central sales fact table and dimensions for Product, Customer, Time, and Store.

21. **Surrogate Key**
    - **Definition**: A unique identifier for a record in a dimension table, often a sequential number.
    - **Example**: A surrogate key for a Customer Dimension might be a unique customer ID generated by the system.

22. **Table**
    - **Definition**: A collection of related data held in a structured format within a database.
    - **Example**: A Customer table in a database containing customer information.

23. **Transformation**
    - **Definition**: The process of converting data from one format or structure to another.
    - **Example**: Converting dates from different formats to a standard format during the ETL process.

24. **Transaction**
    - **Definition**: A discrete unit of work that is performed within a database.
    - **Example**: A sales transaction recording the sale of a product to a customer.
