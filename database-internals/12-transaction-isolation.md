### Detailed Notes of Chapter 12: Transaction Isolation from "Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work" by Alex Petrov

#### Overview
- This chapter discusses transaction isolation, a fundamental concept for ensuring data integrity and consistency in database systems.
- It explores various isolation levels, their properties, and the trade-offs between concurrency and consistency.

### Key Concepts

1. **Transaction Isolation:**
   - **Definition:** The degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions.
   - **Purpose:** Ensures data consistency and prevents anomalies during concurrent transaction execution.

2. **ACID Properties:**
   - **Atomicity:** Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.
   - **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
   - **Isolation:** Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
   - **Durability:** Ensures that the results of a committed transaction are permanently recorded.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Isolation Levels:**
   - **Read Uncommitted:**
     - Transactions can read uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
     - **Advantages:** High concurrency.
     - **Disadvantages:** Allows dirty reads, leading to potential anomalies.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
       ```

   - **Read Committed:**
     - Transactions can only read committed changes made by other transactions.
     - **Advantages:** Prevents dirty reads.
     - **Disadvantages:** Allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
       ```

   - **Repeatable Read:**
     - Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, it will read the same value again even if other transactions modify it.
     - **Advantages:** Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
     - **Disadvantages:** Allows phantom reads.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
       ```

   - **Serializable:**
     - Ensures complete isolation by making transactions appear as if they were executed serially.
     - **Advantages:** Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
     - **Disadvantages:** Lowest concurrency, highest overhead.
     - **Example:**
       ```sql
       SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
       ```

2. **Phenomena in Transaction Isolation:**
   - **Dirty Reads:**
     - A transaction reads uncommitted changes made by another transaction.
   - **Non-Repeatable Reads:**
     - A transaction reads the same value multiple times and gets different results due to changes made by other transactions.
   - **Phantom Reads:**
     - A transaction re-executes a query and sees new rows that were inserted by other transactions after the initial read.

3. **Techniques for Ensuring Isolation:**
   - **Locks:**
     - **Shared Locks:** Allow multiple transactions to read a resource but not modify it.
     - **Exclusive Locks:** Allow only one transaction to modify a resource.
     - **Deadlocks:** Situations where two or more transactions wait for each other to release locks, causing a cycle.
   - **Timestamps:**
     - Each transaction is assigned a timestamp, and operations are ordered based on these timestamps to ensure consistency.
   - **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control):**
     - Maintains multiple versions of data to allow transactions to access a consistent snapshot without locking.
     - **Advantages:** Reduces contention, allows for higher concurrency.
     - **Disadvantages:** Requires additional storage for multiple versions.

4. **Implementation of Isolation Levels:**
   - **Example Implementation of Read Committed:**
     ```java
     public class Database {
         private Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<>();
         private Set<String> lockedKeys = new HashSet<>();

         public synchronized String read(String key) {
             return data.get(key);
         }

         public synchronized void write(String key, String value) throws InterruptedException {
             while (lockedKeys.contains(key)) {
                 wait();
             }
             lockedKeys.add(key);
             data.put(key, value);
             lockedKeys.remove(key);
             notifyAll();
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Trade-offs in Isolation Levels:**
   - **Performance vs. Consistency:**
     - Lower isolation levels provide higher performance and concurrency but may compromise data consistency.
     - Higher isolation levels ensure strong consistency but can significantly impact performance.
   - **Choosing the Right Isolation Level:**
     - Depends on the application's requirements for consistency, performance, and concurrency.

### Practical Examples

1. **Read Uncommitted Example:**
   - **Scenario:** Transaction A reads data being modified by Transaction B, even if B has not committed its changes.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;
     ```

2. **Serializable Isolation Level Example:**
   - **Scenario:** Transactions are executed in such a way that the result is equivalent to some serial execution of the transactions.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (3, 1000);
     ```

3. **MVCC Implementation Example:**
   - **Concept:** Using MVCC to provide consistent reads without locking.
   - **Example Implementation:**
     ```java
     public class MVCCDatabase {
         private Map<String, List<VersionedValue>> data = new HashMap<>();

         public String read(String key, long timestamp) {
             List<VersionedValue> versions = data.get(key);
             for (VersionedValue version : versions) {
                 if (version.timestamp <= timestamp) {
                     return version.value;
                 }
             }
             return null;
         }

         public void write(String key, String value, long timestamp) {
             List<VersionedValue> versions = data.getOrDefault(key, new ArrayList<>());
             versions.add(new VersionedValue(value, timestamp));
             data.put(key, versions);
         }
     }

     class VersionedValue {
         String value;
         long timestamp;

         VersionedValue(String value, long timestamp) {
             this.value = value;
             this.timestamp = timestamp;
         }
     }
     ```

### Key Points to Remember
