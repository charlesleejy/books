### Detailed Notes of Chapter 14: Recovery from "Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work" by Alex Petrov

#### Overview
- This chapter covers the mechanisms and strategies for database recovery, ensuring data durability and consistency in the event of failures.
- Recovery processes are critical for maintaining the integrity and availability of data in distributed systems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Recovery:**
   - **Definition:** The process of restoring a database to a correct state after a failure.
   - **Purpose:** Ensures data durability and consistency by recovering from crashes, hardware failures, or software bugs.

2. **Types of Failures:**
   - **Transaction Failures:** Occur when a transaction cannot be completed due to logical errors or violations of constraints.
   - **System Failures:** Occur when the entire system crashes due to hardware or software issues.
   - **Media Failures:** Occur when storage media, such as disks, fail, leading to data loss.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Logging:**
   - **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):**
     - Ensures that all changes are logged before they are applied to the database.
     - **Components:**
       - **Log Records:** Contain information about changes made by transactions.
       - **Log Buffer:** Temporarily holds log records before writing them to disk.
     - **Process:**
       - Before any change is made to the database, a log record is written to the log buffer.
       - The log buffer is periodically flushed to disk.
       - In case of a failure, the log can be replayed to redo changes and restore the database to a consistent state.
     - **Example:**
       ```java
       class WriteAheadLog {
           private List<String> logBuffer = new ArrayList<>();

           public void log(String record) {
               logBuffer.add(record);
               if (logBuffer.size() >= 100) {
                   flush();
               }
           }

           public void flush() {
               for (String record : logBuffer) {
                   // Write log record to disk
               }
               logBuffer.clear();
           }

           public void replay() {
               // Read log records from disk and apply changes to the database
           }
       }
       ```

2. **Checkpointing:**
   - **Concept:** Periodically save the current state of the database to reduce the amount of work needed during recovery.
   - **Process:**
     - During checkpointing, all modified data is written to disk, and a checkpoint record is written to the log.
     - In case of a failure, recovery starts from the last checkpoint, applying only the changes made since then.
   - **Types:**
     - **Consistent Checkpointing:** Ensures that the database state at the checkpoint is consistent.
     - **Fuzzy Checkpointing:** Allows some in-flight transactions during checkpointing, which may require additional recovery work.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class CheckpointManager {
         private WriteAheadLog wal;

         public CheckpointManager(WriteAheadLog wal) {
             this.wal = wal;
         }

         public void createCheckpoint() {
             // Write all modified data to disk
             // Write a checkpoint record to the log
             wal.log("CHECKPOINT");
         }

         public void recover() {
             wal.replay();
             // Apply changes from the last checkpoint to the current state
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Recovery Techniques:**
   - **Undo/Redo Logging:**
     - **Undo:** Reverts changes made by transactions that were active at the time of failure.
     - **Redo:** Reapplies changes made by committed transactions to ensure durability.
   - **ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics):**
     - A sophisticated recovery algorithm that uses WAL, checkpoints, and a combination of undo and redo operations.
     - **Phases:**
       - **Analysis:** Identifies which transactions need to be undone or redone.
       - **Redo:** Reapplies all changes from the log to ensure all committed transactions are reflected in the database.
       - **Undo:** Reverts changes made by incomplete transactions.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class RecoveryManager {
         private WriteAheadLog wal;

         public RecoveryManager(WriteAheadLog wal) {
             this.wal = wal;
         }

         public void recover() {
             // Analysis phase
             List<String> logRecords = wal.readLog();
             List<String> redoRecords = new ArrayList<>();
             List<String> undoRecords = new ArrayList<>();
             for (String record : logRecords) {
                 if (record.startsWith("COMMIT")) {
                     redoRecords.add(record);
                 } else if (record.startsWith("BEGIN")) {
                     undoRecords.add(record);
                 }
             }

             // Redo phase
             for (String record : redoRecords) {
                 // Reapply changes to the database
             }

             // Undo phase
             for (String record : undoRecords) {
                 // Revert changes in the database
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Distributed Recovery:**
   - **Challenges:** Coordinating recovery across multiple nodes in a distributed system.
   - **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**
     - Ensures that a transaction is either committed or aborted across all nodes.
     - **Phases:**
       - **Prepare Phase:** The coordinator sends a prepare message to all participants, who then vote to commit or abort.
       - **Commit Phase:** If all participants vote to commit, the coordinator sends a commit message; otherwise, it sends an abort message.
     - **Example:**
       ```java
       class TwoPhaseCommit {
           private List<Participant> participants = new ArrayList<>();

           public void prepare() {
               for (Participant participant : participants) {
                   if (!participant.prepare()) {
                       abort();
                       return;
                   }
               }
               commit();
           }

           public void commit() {
               for (Participant participant : participants) {
                   participant.commit();
               }
           }

           public void abort() {
               for (Participant participant : participants) {
                   participant.abort();
               }
           }
       }

       class Participant {
           public boolean prepare() {
               // Prepare to commit transaction
               return true;
           }

           public void commit() {
               // Commit transaction
           }

           public void abort() {
               // Abort transaction
           }
       }
       ```

### Key Points to Remember

- **Recovery:** Ensures data durability and consistency in the event of failures.
- **Logging and Checkpointing:** Critical techniques for capturing changes and reducing recovery time.
- **Recovery Techniques:** Undo/Redo logging and ARIES provide robust mechanisms for recovering from failures.
- **Distributed Recovery:** Two-Phase Commit ensures that distributed transactions are consistently committed or aborted across all nodes.

### Summary

- **Recovery Mechanisms:** Essential for maintaining data integrity and availability in database systems.
- **Techniques and Strategies:** Logging, checkpointing, undo/redo logging, and distributed recovery techniques ensure robust recovery processes.
- **Trade-offs:** Balance between performance and recovery time, with more frequent checkpoints and logging providing faster recovery at the cost of runtime performance.
