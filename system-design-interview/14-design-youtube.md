   - **Video Streaming**: Stream videos to users with various qualities.
   - **Video Search**: Search for videos by title, description, and tags.
   - **Recommendation System**: Suggest videos based on user preferences and behavior.
   - **User Interaction**: Support likes, comments, and subscriptions.
   - **Notifications**: Notify users about new videos, comments, and other activities.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - **Scalability**: Handle a large number of users and videos.
   - **Performance**: Low latency for video streaming and quick search results.
   - **Reliability**: Ensure video availability and data integrity.
   - **Security**: Secure user data and prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Extensibility**: Easily add new features and support new video formats.

#### High-level Design

1. **Architecture Overview**:
   - **Client Interface**: User interface for video upload, playback, search, and interactions.
   - **API Gateway**: Manages API requests from the client.
   - **Video Processing Service**: Handles video upload, transcoding, and storage.
   - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distributes video content to users globally.
   - **Search Service**: Indexes videos and handles search queries.
   - **Recommendation System**: Provides personalized video recommendations.
   - **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and interactions.
   - **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.
   - **Analytics Service**: Tracks video views, user interactions, and other metrics.

2. **Workflow**:
   - **Video Upload**: User uploads a video, which is processed and stored.
   - **Video Playback**: User requests to play a video, which is streamed from the CDN.
   - **Search and Recommendation**: User searches for videos or receives recommendations.
   - **User Interaction**: Users like, comment, and subscribe to channels.
   - **Notifications**: Users receive notifications about new activities.

#### Detailed Design

1. **Video Upload and Processing**:
   - **Upload Handling**: Handle large file uploads, support resumable uploads.
   - **Transcoding**: Convert videos to various formats and resolutions for compatibility and adaptive streaming.
   - **Storage**: Store original and transcoded videos in a distributed storage system (e.g., Amazon S3).

2. **Video Streaming**:
   - **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Use protocols like HLS or DASH to adjust video quality based on the user's bandwidth.
   - **CDN Integration**: Use CDNs to cache and deliver videos to users with low latency.

3. **Search and Indexing**:
   - **Indexing Service**: Index video metadata (title, description, tags) for quick search retrieval.
   - **Search Algorithms**: Implement efficient search algorithms to handle user queries.

4. **Recommendation System**:
   - **User Data**: Collect data on user behavior (views, likes, subscriptions).
   - **Recommendation Algorithms**: Use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and machine learning models to generate recommendations.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - **Like and Comment System**: Allow users to like and comment on videos.
   - **Subscription Management**: Enable users to subscribe to channels and manage subscriptions.
   - **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets or long polling to update likes, comments, and subscriptions in real-time.

6. **Notification Service**:
   - **Push Notifications**: Send real-time notifications for new videos, comments, and other activities.
   - **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications for updates and activities.

7. **Analytics and Monitoring**:
   - **Metrics Collection**: Track video views, user interactions, and other metrics.
   - **Real-time Analytics**: Provide real-time analytics for video performance and user engagement.

#### Advanced Features

1. **Security and Privacy**:
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user authentication (e.g., OAuth) and access control.
   - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
   - **Content Moderation**: Implement automated and manual content moderation to prevent inappropriate content.

2. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to handle high load.
   - **Database Sharding**: Partition databases to manage large volumes of data.
   - **Caching**: Use caching to speed up data retrieval and reduce load on databases.

3. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**:
   - **Data Replication**: Replicate data across multiple servers to ensure availability.
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Implement backup strategies to recover from data loss.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - **Modular Architecture**: Design the system with a modular architecture to easily add new features.
   - **API Integration**: Provide APIs for third-party integrations and extensions.

#### Example Workflow

1. **Video Upload**:
   - User uploads a video.
   - Video processing service handles the upload, transcodes the video, and stores it in distributed storage.
   - Metadata is indexed by the search service.

2. **Video Playback**:
   - User requests to play a video.
   - Video is retrieved from the CDN and streamed to the user using adaptive bitrate streaming.

3. **Search and Recommendation**:
   - User searches for a video.
   - Search service retrieves and ranks relevant videos.
   - User receives personalized video recommendations based on their behavior and preferences.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - User likes and comments on a video.
   - Interaction data is stored and real-time updates are sent to other users.

5. **Notifications**:
   - User subscribes to a channel.
   - Notification service sends real-time and email notifications for new videos and activities.
