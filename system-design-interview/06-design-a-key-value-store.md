### Chapter 6: Design a Key-value Store

#### Introduction
A key-value store is a fundamental building block in many distributed systems, providing a simple yet powerful interface for storing and retrieving data. This chapter discusses how to design a scalable, efficient, and robust key-value store, covering various aspects from basic requirements to advanced features.

#### Understanding Key-value Stores
- **Concept**: A key-value store is a type of NoSQL database that uses a simple data model consisting of key-value pairs.
- **Use Cases**: Caching, session management, user preferences, shopping carts, and more.

#### Basic Requirements
1. **Basic Operations**:
   - **PUT**: Store a key-value pair.
   - **GET**: Retrieve the value associated with a key.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a key-value pair.
2. **Performance**: Fast reads and writes, low latency.
3. **Scalability**: Handle increasing loads by scaling horizontally.
4. **Durability**: Ensure data is not lost in case of failures.

#### High-level Design
1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Clients interact with a cluster of servers that store the key-value data.
2. **Partitioning**: Data is distributed across multiple servers to balance the load and provide scalability.
3. **Replication**: Data is replicated across servers to ensure durability and high availability.

#### Detailed Design

1. **Data Partitioning**:
   - **Consistent Hashing**: Use consistent hashing to distribute keys across multiple servers, minimizing the impact of server additions/removals.
   - **Alternative Strategies**: Range partitioning or hash partitioning.

2. **Data Replication**:
   - **Leader-Follower Model**: One server acts as the leader, and others as followers. Writes go to the leader and are replicated to followers.
   - **Quorum-based Replication**: Require a majority of replicas to acknowledge a write before considering it successful.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **In-memory Storage**: For high-speed access, store data in memory (e.g., Redis).
   - **Persistent Storage**: Use disk-based storage for durability (e.g., LevelDB, RocksDB).

4. **Handling Writes (PUT Requests)**:
   - **Write Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across replicas (strong, eventual, or causal consistency).
   - **Write Path**: Client sends a write request to the leader, which replicates the data to followers.

5. **Handling Reads (GET Requests)**:
   - **Read Consistency**: Define consistency levels for reads (strong, eventual).
   - **Read Path**: Clients can read from the leader or followers, depending on the consistency requirement.

6. **Handling Deletes**:
   - **Delete Propagation**: Ensure deletes are propagated to all replicas.
   - **Tombstones**: Mark deleted keys with tombstones to handle eventual consistency.

#### Advanced Features

1. **Compaction**:
   - **Log-structured Storage**: Use log-structured storage to manage writes and handle compaction.
   - **Garbage Collection**: Periodically remove deleted entries and old versions.

2. **Caching**:
   - **In-memory Caches**: Use in-memory caches to speed up read operations.
   - **Cache Eviction Policies**: Implement policies like LRU (Least Recently Used) to manage cache size.

3. **Consistency Models**:
   - **Strong Consistency**: Guarantees that reads always return the latest written value.
   - **Eventual Consistency**: Ensures that all replicas converge to the same value eventually.
   - **Causal Consistency**: Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all nodes in the same order.

4. **High Availability**:
   - **Replication**: Ensure multiple copies of data are maintained across different nodes.
   - **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically handle server failures by promoting followers to leaders.

5. **Scalability**:
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more nodes to the cluster to handle increased load.
   - **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of nodes based on current load.

6. **Security**:
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement security mechanisms to control access.
   - **Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.

#### Example: Implementing a Simple Key-value Store
The chapter walks through an example implementation:
1. **Setup**: Initialize a cluster with a set of nodes.
2. **PUT Operation**: Implement the logic to store a key-value pair, ensuring data is partitioned and replicated.
3. **GET Operation**: Implement the logic to retrieve a value, ensuring it respects the desired consistency level.
4. **DELETE Operation**: Implement the logic to remove a key-value pair and propagate the delete across replicas.
5. **Consistency and Replication**: Implement mechanisms to maintain consistency and handle replication.

#### Conclusion
Designing a key-value store involves understanding the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem). By carefully designing partitioning, replication, and consistency mechanisms, one can build a scalable, reliable, and efficient key-value store. This chapter equips readers with the knowledge and strategies needed to design such a system, providing a solid foundation for system design interviews.
