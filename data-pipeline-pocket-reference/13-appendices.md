# Chapter 13: Appendices

### 13.1 Glossary of Terms
- **Batch Processing**: Processing large volumes of data in fixed-size chunks at scheduled intervals.
- **Stream Processing**: Continuous data processing as data flows in real-time.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A process that extracts data from sources, transforms it, and loads it into a target system.
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: A process where data is extracted and loaded into the target system before being transformed.
- **Data Lake**: A centralized repository that allows storage of structured and unstructured data at any scale.
- **Data Warehouse**: A system used for reporting and data analysis, storing current and historical data in one place.
- **Data Ingestion**: The process of collecting and importing data for immediate or future use.
- **Data Transformation**: The process of converting data from its raw format into a structured and usable format.
- **Data Orchestration**: The coordination and management of data processing tasks in a pipeline.
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking the origins, movements, and transformations of data throughout its lifecycle.
- **Metadata**: Data that provides information about other data, such as schema, format, and source.
