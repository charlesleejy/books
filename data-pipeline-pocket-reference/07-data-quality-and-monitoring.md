# Chapter 7: Data Quality and Monitoring

### 7.1 Overview of Data Quality
- **Definition**: Data quality refers to the condition of data based on factors like accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance.
- **Purpose**: Ensuring high data quality is essential for making reliable business decisions and performing accurate analyses.
- **Key Dimensions**:
  - **Accuracy**: Correctness of the data.
  - **Completeness**: Extent to which all required data is present.
  - **Consistency**: Uniformity of data across different datasets.
  - **Timeliness**: Data is up-to-date and available when needed.
  - **Validity**: Data conforms to defined formats and standards.
  - **Uniqueness**: No duplicate records exist in the dataset.

### 7.2 Data Quality Dimensions
- **Accuracy**: Ensuring that data accurately represents the real-world entities and events it is supposed to model.
- **Completeness**: Ensuring all required data fields are populated and no critical data is missing.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring data is consistent within a dataset and across different datasets.
- **Timeliness**: Ensuring data is up-to-date and available for processing and decision-making.
- **Validity**: Ensuring data values conform to the expected formats and business rules.
- **Uniqueness**: Ensuring that each record is unique and there are no duplicates.
