### Detailed Notes on Chapter 15: Structured Streaming
**"Spark: The Definitive Guide" by Bill Chambers and Matei Zaharia**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 15 provides a deep dive into Structured Streaming in Apache Spark. Structured Streaming is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine. This chapter covers the basics of Structured Streaming, its components, and how to build and manage streaming applications.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Introduction to Structured Streaming**
   - **Definition**:
     - Structured Streaming is a stream processing engine that treats real-time data as a continuously updating table.
   - **Unified Batch and Streaming**:
     - The same API can be used for both batch and streaming data processing.
   - **Event-Time Processing**:
     - Handles event-time data, ensuring correct processing based on the time events actually occurred.

2. **Basic Concepts**
   - **Streaming DataFrame/Dataset**:
     - Represents a continuous stream of data.
   - **Triggers**:
     - Define how often the streaming query should run. Options include continuous, fixed interval, and one-time processing.
   - **Output Modes**:
     - Append: Only new rows since the last trigger are written to the sink.
     - Complete: The entire updated result table is written to the sink.
     - Update: Only rows that were updated since the last trigger are written to the sink.

3. **Creating Streaming DataFrames**
   - **Reading from File Sources**:
     - Example of reading from a file source as a stream:
       ```scala
       val streamingDF = spark.readStream
         .format("csv")
         .option("header", "true")
         .schema(schema)
         .load("path/to/directory")
       ```
   - **Reading from Kafka**:
     - Example of reading from a Kafka topic:
       ```scala
       val kafkaDF = spark.readStream
         .format("kafka")
         .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "host1:port1,host2:port2")
         .option("subscribe", "topic1")
         .load()
       ```

4. **Writing Streaming DataFrames**
   - **Writing to Console**:
     - Example of writing streaming data to the console:
       ```scala
       val query = streamingDF.writeStream
         .format("console")
         .outputMode("append")
         .start()
       ```
   - **Writing to Files**:
     - Example of writing streaming data to files:
       ```scala
       val query = streamingDF.writeStream
         .format("parquet")
         .option("path", "path/to/output")
         .option("checkpointLocation", "path/to/checkpoint")
         .start()
       ```
   - **Writing to Kafka**:
     - Example of writing streaming data to a Kafka topic:
       ```scala
       val query = streamingDF.writeStream
         .format("kafka")
         .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "host1:port1,host2:port2")
         .option("topic", "outputTopic")
         .start()
       ```

5. **Windowed Aggregations**
   - **Window Functions**:
     - Perform aggregations over a sliding window of time.
   - **Example**:
     ```scala
     import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

     val windowedCounts = streamingDF
       .groupBy(window($"timestamp", "10 minutes", "5 minutes"), $"word")
       .count()

     val query = windowedCounts.writeStream
       .format("console")
       .outputMode("complete")
       .start()
     ```

6. **Watermarking**
   - **Handling Late Data**:
     - Define a threshold for how late data can arrive using watermarks.
   - **Example**:
     ```scala
     val withWatermarks = streamingDF
       .withWatermark("timestamp", "10 minutes")
       .groupBy(window($"timestamp", "10 minutes", "5 minutes"), $"word")
       .count()

     val query = withWatermarks.writeStream
       .format("console")
       .outputMode("update")
       .start()
     ```

7. **Stateful Operations**
   - **State Management**:
     - Stateful operations like joins and aggregations require maintaining state between processing steps.
   - **Example**:
     ```scala
     val statefulDF = streamingDF
       .groupBy($"userId")
       .agg(sum($"amount").as("totalSpent"))

     val query = statefulDF.writeStream
       .format("console")
       .outputMode("update")
       .start()
     ```

8. **Fault Tolerance and Checkpointing**
   - **Ensuring Fault Tolerance**:
     - Checkpointing saves the state of the streaming query to reliable storage.
   - **Example**:
     ```scala
     val query = streamingDF.writeStream
       .format("parquet")
       .option("path", "path/to/output")
       .option("checkpointLocation", "path/to/checkpoint")
       .start()
     ```

9. **Joins in Streaming Queries**
   - **Stream-Static Joins**:
     - Join a streaming DataFrame with a static DataFrame.
     - Example:
       ```scala
       val staticDF = spark.read.parquet("path/to/static/data")
       val joinedDF = streamingDF.join(staticDF, "key")
       val query = joinedDF.writeStream.format("console").start()
       ```
   - **Stream-Stream Joins**:
     - Join two streaming DataFrames.
     - Example:
       ```scala
       val stream1 = spark.readStream.format("kafka").option("subscribe", "topic1").load()
       val stream2 = spark.readStream.format("kafka").option("subscribe", "topic2").load()
       val joinedDF = stream1.join(stream2, expr("stream1.key = stream2.key"))
       val query = joinedDF.writeStream.format("console").start()
       ```

10. **Output Modes**
    - **Append Mode**:
      - Only new rows added since the last trigger are written to the sink.
    - **Complete Mode**:
      - The entire updated result table is written to the sink.
    - **Update Mode**:
      - Only rows that were updated since the last trigger are written to the sink.

11. **Triggers**
    - **Continuous Processing**:
      - Run the query as fast as possible.
    - **Fixed Interval Processing**:
      - Run the query at fixed intervals.
      - Example:
        ```scala
        val query = streamingDF.writeStream.trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime("10 seconds")).format("console").start()
        ```

12. **Monitoring and Debugging**
    - **Monitoring with Web UI**:
      - Spark’s web UI provides insights into the status of streaming queries.
      - Accessible at `http://<driver-node>:4040`.
    - **Query Progress**:
      - Track the progress and performance of streaming queries.
      - Example:
        ```scala
        val query = streamingDF.writeStream.format("console").start()
        query.awaitTermination()
        println(query.lastProgress)
        ```
