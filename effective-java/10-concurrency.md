## Chapter 10: Concurrency

#### Item 78: Synchronize access to shared mutable data
**Explanation:**
- Synchronization is necessary to ensure that only one thread accesses shared mutable data at a time, preventing data corruption and inconsistent state.

**Guidelines:**
- Use the `synchronized` keyword to synchronize methods or blocks of code.
- Use `java.util.concurrent` utilities like `ReentrantLock` for advanced synchronization.

**Example:**
```java
public class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents concurrent modification issues.
- Ensures data consistency and thread safety.

#### Item 79: Avoid excessive synchronization
**Explanation:**
- Over-synchronizing can lead to contention, reduced concurrency, and performance degradation.

**Guidelines:**
- Synchronize only the critical sections of code.
- Use concurrent collections from `java.util.concurrent` to reduce the need for explicit synchronization.

**Example:**
```java
public class FineGrainedLocking {
    private final Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<>();
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void put(String key, String value) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            data.put(key, value);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public String get(String key) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return data.get(key);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves concurrency by reducing contention.
- Enhances performance by minimizing the synchronized code section.

#### Item 80: Prefer executors and tasks to threads
**Explanation:**
- Executors provide a higher-level replacement for working directly with threads, making it easier to manage thread life cycles and improve scalability.

**Guidelines:**
- Use `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of worker threads.
- Submit tasks to the executor rather than creating new threads directly.

**Example:**
```java
public class TaskExecutor {
    private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

    public void submitTask(Runnable task) {
        executor.submit(task);
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Simplifies thread management.
- Allows better control over the execution environment and resource allocation.

#### Item 81: Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify
**Explanation:**
- Concurrency utilities in `java.util.concurrent` are higher-level and easier to use than low-level synchronization constructs like `wait` and `notify`.

**Guidelines:**
- Use classes like `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, and `BlockingQueue` to manage synchronization.

**Example:**
```java
public class CountDownLatchExample {
    private final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

    public void waitForCompletion() throws InterruptedException {
        latch.await();
    }

    public void taskCompleted() {
        latch.countDown();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves readability and maintainability.
- Reduces the likelihood of concurrency bugs.

#### Item 82: Document thread safety
**Explanation:**
- Clearly document the thread-safety guarantees of your classes and methods to help users understand how to use them correctly in a concurrent environment.

**Guidelines:**
- Use annotations like `@ThreadSafe` and `@NotThreadSafe`.
- Provide detailed documentation in Javadocs.

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Thread-safe counter class.
 * This class is safe to use concurrently by multiple threads.
 */
@ThreadSafe
public class ThreadSafeCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Enhances code clarity and usability.
- Helps prevent incorrect usage and concurrency issues.

#### Item 83: Use lazy initialization judiciously
**Explanation:**
- Lazy initialization can improve performance by delaying the creation of expensive objects until they are needed. However, it should be used carefully to avoid concurrency issues.

**Guidelines:**
- Use lazy initialization only when necessary.
- Use the `volatile` keyword or `synchronized` blocks to ensure thread safety.

**Example:**
```java
public class LazyInitialization {
    private volatile ExpensiveObject instance;

    public ExpensiveObject getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (this) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new ExpensiveObject();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces initial load time and memory usage.
- Ensures thread-safe initialization.

#### Item 84: Don't depend on the thread scheduler
**Explanation:**
- Relying on the thread scheduler for correct execution can lead to unpredictable behavior. It's better to design programs that do not depend on thread priorities or yields.

**Guidelines:**
- Avoid using `Thread.yield()` and thread priorities for correctness.
- Use proper synchronization and coordination mechanisms.

**Example:**
```java
public class AvoidThreadYield {
    private volatile boolean done = false;

    public void waitForCompletion() {
        while (!done) {
            // Do some work or sleep
        }
    }

    public void complete() {
        done = true;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Increases portability and predictability of code.
- Ensures correctness independent of the thread scheduler.

#### Item 85: Document thread safety of classes and methods
**Explanation:**
- Properly documenting the thread-safety characteristics of classes and methods is crucial for users to understand how to use them correctly in a concurrent context.

**Guidelines:**
- Use annotations like `@ThreadSafe`, `@NotThreadSafe`, and `@Immutable` to indicate the thread-safety properties.
- Provide clear and detailed documentation in the Javadocs.

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Thread-safe class representing a bank account.
 * This class can be safely accessed by multiple threads.
 */
@ThreadSafe
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public synchronized double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Helps users understand how to use the class correctly.
- Reduces the likelihood of concurrency-related bugs.
