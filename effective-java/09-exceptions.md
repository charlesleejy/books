## Chapter 9: Exceptions

#### Item 69: Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions
**Explanation:**
- Exceptions should represent exceptional conditions, not control flow or expected conditions.

**Guidelines:**
- Do not use exceptions for ordinary control flow, as it is both inefficient and confusing.

**Example:**
```java
// Using exceptions for control flow (not recommended)
try {
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        range[i++].climb();
    }
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    // No more elements
}

// Using regular control flow (recommended)
for (int i = 0; i < range.length; i++) {
    range[i].climb();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves code clarity and performance.

#### Item 70: Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors
**Explanation:**
- Checked exceptions signal conditions from which the caller can potentially recover.
- Runtime exceptions indicate programming errors.

**Guidelines:**
- Use checked exceptions for conditions that the caller might reasonably be expected to recover from.
- Use unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) for programming errors such as violations of class invariants.

**Example:**
```java
// Using checked exception for recoverable condition
public class FileParser {
    public void parse(File file) throws IOException {
        // code to parse file
    }
}

// Using unchecked exception for programming error
public class Calculator {
    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Divisor cannot be zero");
        }
        return a / b;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Helps differentiate between recoverable conditions and programming errors, leading to more robust and readable code.

#### Item 71: Avoid unnecessary use of checked exceptions
**Explanation:**
- Overuse of checked exceptions can clutter method signatures and make APIs harder to use.

**Guidelines:**
- Use checked exceptions sparingly and only when the caller can realistically handle the exception.

**Example:**
```java
// Using checked exception unnecessarily (not recommended)
public void connect() throws IOException {
    // code that rarely throws IOException
}

// Using unchecked exception (recommended)
public void connect() {
    try {
        // code that rarely throws IOException
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces unnecessary complexity in APIs and improves usability.

#### Item 72: Favor the use of standard exceptions
**Explanation:**
- Java provides a set of standard exceptions that are well-known and widely used.

**Guidelines:**
- Use standard exceptions like `IllegalArgumentException`, `IllegalStateException`, `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc., instead of creating custom exceptions.

**Example:**
```java
// Using custom exception (not recommended)
public class InvalidUserInputException extends RuntimeException {
    public InvalidUserInputException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// Using standard exception (recommended)
public class UserInputHandler {
    public void handle(String input) {
        if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null or empty");
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves code readability and consistency.
- Leverages the familiarity and conventions of standard exceptions.

#### Item 73: Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction
**Explanation:**
- Exceptions thrown by a method should match the abstraction level of the method, hiding implementation details.

**Guidelines:**
- Convert lower-level exceptions to higher-level ones that make sense in the context of the method’s abstraction.

**Example:**
```java
// Exposing low-level exception (not recommended)
public class DatabaseConnection {
    public void connect() throws SQLException {
        // code to connect to database
    }
}

// Throwing exception appropriate to the abstraction (recommended)
public class DatabaseConnection {
    public void connect() {
        try {
            // code to connect to database
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new DatabaseException("Failed to connect to database", e);
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps the abstraction intact and makes the API easier to understand and use.

#### Item 74: Document all exceptions thrown by each method
**Explanation:**
- Proper documentation of exceptions helps users of the method understand the conditions under which exceptions are thrown and how to handle them.

**Guidelines:**
- Use the `@throws` Javadoc tag to document all exceptions that a method can throw.

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Connects to the specified URL.
 *
 * @param url the URL to connect to
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the URL is null or malformed
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public void connect(URL url) throws IOException {
    if (url == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("URL cannot be null");
    }
    // code to connect to URL
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Provides clear and comprehensive documentation.
- Helps callers understand how to handle exceptions.

#### Item 75: Include failure-capture information in detail messages
**Explanation:**
- Detailed exception messages provide valuable information for debugging and understanding the cause of the exception.

**Guidelines:**
- Include relevant data that captures the context of the failure in the exception message.

**Example:**
```java
public class Account {
    private double balance;

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > balance) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount exceeds balance: " + amount + " > " + balance);
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Makes exceptions more informative and helpful for debugging.
- Reduces the time needed to diagnose issues.

#### Item 76: Strive for failure atomicity
**Explanation:**
- Methods should leave objects in a consistent state even if they fail partway through their execution.

**Guidelines:**
- Design methods to either complete successfully or throw an exception without modifying the object’s state.

**Example:**
```java
// Method that ensures failure atomicity
public void transfer(Account from, Account to, double amount) {
    if (amount > from.getBalance()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Transfer amount exceeds balance");
    }
    synchronized (this) {
        from.withdraw(amount);
        to.deposit(amount);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures the object’s integrity and consistency.
- Prevents partial updates that can lead to difficult-to-debug errors.

#### Item 77: Don't ignore exceptions
**Explanation:**
- Ignoring exceptions can lead to unnoticed failures and bugs.

**Guidelines:**
- Always handle exceptions appropriately, even if it’s just logging the error.

**Example:**
```java
// Ignoring exception (not recommended)
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Do nothing
}

// Handling exception appropriately (recommended)
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace(); // or use a logger
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures that failures are noticed and can be addressed.
- Helps in diagnosing and fixing issues.
