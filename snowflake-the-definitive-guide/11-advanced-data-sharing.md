### Detailed Notes on Chapter 11: Advanced Data Sharing
**"Snowflake: The Definitive Guide" by Joyce Kay Avila**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 11 delves into the advanced features and capabilities of data sharing in Snowflake. It explores the nuances of secure data sharing, managing reader accounts, sharing across regions and clouds, and best practices for effective data sharing.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Introduction to Advanced Data Sharing**
   - **Definition and Importance**:
     - Data sharing enables secure and efficient sharing of data across different Snowflake accounts without data duplication.
     - Essential for collaboration, data monetization, and enabling a data-driven culture.

2. **Creating and Managing Secure Shares**
   - **Creating Shares**:
     - SQL command to create a share.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE SHARE my_share;
       ```
   - **Adding Objects to Shares**:
     - Adding databases, schemas, and tables to a share.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE my_database TO SHARE my_share;
       GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema TO SHARE my_share;
       ```
   - **Granting Access to Consumer Accounts**:
     - Providing access to specific consumer accounts.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       ALTER SHARE my_share ADD ACCOUNTS = 'consumer_account';
       ```
   - **Revoking Access**:
     - Revoking access to ensure data security.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       ALTER SHARE my_share REMOVE ACCOUNTS = 'consumer_account';
       ```

3. **Managing Reader Accounts**
   - **Definition and Purpose**:
     - Reader accounts are managed by the data provider, allowing organizations without a Snowflake account to access shared data.
   - **Creating Reader Accounts**:
     - SQL command to create a reader account.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE MANAGED ACCOUNT reader_account ADMIN_NAME = 'reader_admin' ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword!' FIRST_NAME = 'John' LAST_NAME = 'Doe' EMAIL = 'john.doe@example.com';
       ```
   - **Granting Access to Reader Accounts**:
     - Allowing reader accounts to access specific shares.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       ALTER SHARE my_share ADD ACCOUNTS = 'reader_account';
       ```

4. **Cross-Region and Cross-Cloud Data Sharing**
   - **Definition**:
     - Snowflake allows data sharing across different regions and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
   - **Setting Up Cross-Region Sharing**:
     - Ensuring compliance with data residency requirements and network latency considerations.
   - **Steps for Cross-Cloud Sharing**:
     - Configuring network policies and permissions to enable seamless sharing.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       ALTER SHARE my_share SET SHARE_REPLICATION = 'ENABLED';
       ```

5. **Securing Shared Data**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
     - Implementing RBAC to manage access permissions.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE ROLE share_admin;
       GRANT USAGE ON SHARE my_share TO ROLE share_admin;
       GRANT ROLE share_admin TO USER john_doe;
       ```
   - **Data Masking**:
     - Applying dynamic data masking to protect sensitive information.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_ssn AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING -> CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_CONSUMER') THEN 'XXX-XX-XXXX' ELSE val END;
       ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN ssn SET MASKING POLICY mask_ssn;
       ```
   - **Encryption**:
     - Ensuring data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
   - **Monitoring and Auditing**:
     - Using Snowflake’s ACCOUNT_USAGE views to audit data sharing activities.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY WHERE QUERY_TEXT ILIKE '%my_shared_db%';
       ```

6. **Best Practices for Data Sharing**
   - **Granular Access Control**:
     - Provide the least privilege necessary to access data.
   - **Regular Access Reviews**:
     - Periodically review and update access permissions to ensure they align with current needs.
   - **Data Sharing Agreements**:
     - Establish clear agreements on data usage, responsibilities, and security.
   - **Documentation and Communication**:
     - Document data sharing processes and communicate them to all stakeholders.

7. **Use Cases for Advanced Data Sharing**
   - **Collaboration Between Departments**:
     - Enable internal teams to access and collaborate on shared datasets.
   - **Partner Data Sharing**:
     - Share data securely with external partners, vendors, or customers.
   - **Data Monetization**:
     - Provide access to datasets as a product offering for paying customers.

8. **Case Study: Implementing Advanced Data Sharing**
   - **Problem Statement**:
     - A company needs to share sales data with multiple partners across different regions and cloud platforms while ensuring data security and compliance.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use Snowflake’s advanced data sharing features to securely share data, manage access, and monitor usage.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Create shares and add relevant data.
     - Set up reader accounts for partners without Snowflake accounts.
     - Configure cross-region and cross-cloud sharing.
     - Implement security measures like RBAC and data masking.
     - Monitor and audit data sharing activities.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     -- Creating a share
     CREATE SHARE sales_share;
     
     -- Adding data to the share
     GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales_db TO SHARE sales_share;
     GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA sales_db.public TO SHARE sales_share;
     
     -- Creating a reader account
     CREATE MANAGED ACCOUNT partner_reader ADMIN_NAME = 'partner_admin' ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'SecurePassword!' FIRST_NAME = 'Jane' LAST_NAME = 'Doe' EMAIL = 'jane.doe@example.com';
     
     -- Granting access to the reader account
     ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD ACCOUNTS = 'partner_reader';
     
     -- Setting up cross-region sharing
     ALTER SHARE sales_share SET SHARE_REPLICATION = 'ENABLED';
     
     -- Applying data masking
     CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_credit_card AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING -> CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PARTNER') THEN 'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX' ELSE val END;
     ALTER TABLE transactions MODIFY COLUMN credit_card SET MASKING POLICY mask_credit_card;
     
     -- Monitoring shared data access
     SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY WHERE QUERY_TEXT ILIKE '%sales_share%';
     ```
