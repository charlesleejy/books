4. **Creating and Managing Tables**
   - **Creating Tables**:
     - SQL command to create a new table with specified columns and data types.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE my_table (
           id INT,
           name STRING,
           age INT
       );
       ```
   - **Inserting Data**:
     - SQL command to insert data into a table.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       INSERT INTO my_table (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30);
       ```
   - **Viewing Tables and Data**:
     - SQL commands to list tables and query data.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema;
       SELECT * FROM my_table;
       ```

5. **Loading Data into Snowflake**
   - **Bulk Loading with COPY INTO**:
     - SQL command to load data from external files into a Snowflake table.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       COPY INTO my_table
       FROM @my_stage/my_file.csv
       FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
       ```
   - **Using Snowpipe for Continuous Data Loading**:
     - Introduction to Snowpipe for automated, continuous data ingestion.
   - **Loading Semi-Structured Data**:
     - Loading JSON, Avro, Parquet, and ORC files into Snowflake tables.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE my_json_table (json_data VARIANT);
       COPY INTO my_json_table
       FROM @my_stage/my_file.json
       FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
       ```

6. **Querying Data**
   - **Basic SQL Queries**:
     - SQL commands for basic data retrieval.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SELECT name, age FROM my_table WHERE age > 25;
       ```
   - **Joining Tables**:

8. **Best Practices for Working with Snowflake**
   - **Optimizing Query Performance**:
     - Tips for optimizing queries, such as using clustering keys and materialized views.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       ALTER TABLE my_table CLUSTER BY (column1);
       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mv AS
