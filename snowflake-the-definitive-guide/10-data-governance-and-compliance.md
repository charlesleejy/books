## Detailed Notes on Chapter 10: Data Governance and Compliance
**"Snowflake: The Definitive Guide" by Joyce Kay Avila**

#### **Overview**
Chapter 10 focuses on data governance and compliance within the Snowflake environment. It covers the principles of data governance, compliance frameworks, and the tools and practices Snowflake provides to ensure data security, quality, and regulatory adherence.

#### **Key Sections and Points**

1. **Introduction to Data Governance**
   - **Definition**:
     - Data governance involves managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization.
   - **Importance**:
     - Ensures data quality, protects sensitive information, and supports regulatory compliance.

2. **Core Principles of Data Governance**
   - **Data Ownership**:
     - Identifying data stewards responsible for data assets.
   - **Data Quality**:
     - Implementing processes to ensure data is accurate, complete, and reliable.
   - **Data Security**:
     - Protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
   - **Data Lineage**:
     - Tracking the origin, movement, and transformation of data over time.

3. **Data Governance Framework**
   - **Policies and Procedures**:
     - Establishing clear policies for data management and usage.
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**:
     - Defining roles such as data stewards, custodians, and users.
   - **Standards and Metrics**:
     - Setting standards for data quality and metrics for measuring compliance.

4. **Snowflake Tools for Data Governance**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
     - Managing access to data through roles and privileges.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE ROLE data_steward;
       GRANT SELECT ON DATABASE my_database TO ROLE data_steward;
       GRANT ROLE data_steward TO USER jane_doe;
       ```
   - **Dynamic Data Masking**:
     - Protecting sensitive data by masking it based on user roles.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_ssn AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
       CASE
           WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_STEWARD') THEN 'XXX-XX-XXXX'
           ELSE val
       END;
       ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN ssn SET MASKING POLICY mask_ssn;
       ```
   - **Data Lineage and Metadata**:
     - Tracking data lineage using Snowflake's metadata features and third-party tools.
   - **Time Travel and Data Retention**:
     - Using Time Travel to track historical data changes and manage data retention policies.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM my_table AT (TIMESTAMP => '2021-01-01 00:00:00');
       ALTER TABLE my_table SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;
       ```

5. **Compliance Frameworks and Regulations**
   - **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:
     - Ensuring data privacy and protection for individuals within the EU.
   - **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**:
     - Protecting sensitive patient health information.
   - **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**:
     - Enhancing privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.
   - **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**:
     - Securing credit card information during and after transactions.
   - **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)**:
     - Standardizing security assessment and authorization for cloud products and services used by federal agencies.

6. **Implementing Compliance in Snowflake**
   - **Data Classification**:
     - Classifying data based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE TAG sensitive_data;
       ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN ssn SET TAG sensitive_data;
       ```
   - **Audit Trails and Monitoring**:
     - Using Snowflake’s ACCOUNT_USAGE schema to audit and monitor data access and usage.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY WHERE QUERY_TEXT ILIKE '%ssn%';
       ```
   - **Data Encryption**:
     - Ensuring data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to meet compliance requirements.
   - **Access Controls and Policies**:
     - Implementing strict access controls and data masking policies to protect sensitive data.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE NETWORK POLICY secure_access ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.0/8');
       ALTER USER john_doe SET NETWORK_POLICY = secure_access;
       ```

7. **Data Quality Management**
   - **Data Validation and Cleansing**:
     - Implementing processes to validate and cleanse data before it is used.
   - **Monitoring Data Quality**:
     - Regularly monitoring and reporting on data quality metrics.
   - **Data Stewardship**:
     - Assigning data stewards to ensure data quality and compliance with governance policies.

8. **Metadata Management**
   - **Importance of Metadata**:
     - Metadata provides context and meaning to data, supporting data governance and compliance.
   - **Managing Metadata in Snowflake**:
     - Using Snowflake’s information schema and tags to manage metadata.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE TAG data_owner;
       ALTER TABLE employees SET TAG data_owner = 'HR Department';
       SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'employees';
       ```

9. **Case Study: Implementing Data Governance and Compliance**
   - **Problem Statement**:
     - A company needs to implement data governance and compliance practices to protect sensitive data and meet regulatory requirements.
   - **Solution**:
     - Define data governance policies, implement RBAC, dynamic data masking, and monitor data access and quality.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Establish data governance framework and roles.
     - Classify data and apply appropriate access controls and masking policies.
     - Monitor data access and quality using Snowflake’s tools and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     -- Creating roles and assigning privileges
     CREATE ROLE data_steward;
     GRANT SELECT ON DATABASE my_database TO ROLE data_steward;
     GRANT ROLE data_steward TO USER jane_doe;

     -- Implementing dynamic data masking
     CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_credit_card AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
     CASE
         WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_STEWARD') THEN 'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX'
         ELSE val
     END;
     ALTER TABLE transactions MODIFY COLUMN credit_card SET MASKING POLICY mask_credit_card;

     -- Classifying sensitive data
     CREATE TAG sensitive_data;
     ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN ssn SET TAG sensitive_data;

     -- Setting up audit trail
     SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY WHERE QUERY_TEXT ILIKE '%ssn%';
     ```
