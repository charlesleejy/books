### Detailed Breakdown of Mock Exam

#### Object-Oriented Programming

1. **Question: What is polymorphism?**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

2. **Question: How do you achieve encapsulation in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Encapsulation is achieved by using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify these fields.

#### Java Basics

1. **Question: What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?**
   - **Answer:** `==` compares the reference or memory location, whereas `equals()` compares the values of the objects.

2. **Question: What will be the output of the following code?**
   ```java
   int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   System.out.println(arr[2]);
   ```
   - **Answer:** 3

#### Exception Handling

1. **Question: What is the purpose of the `finally` block?**
   - **Answer:** The `finally` block is used to execute important code such as closing resources, and it is always executed whether an exception is handled or not.

2. **Question: How do you create a custom exception in Java?**
   - **Answer:** By extending the `Exception` class or any of its subclasses.

   ```java
   public class MyCustomException extends Exception {
       public MyCustomException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```

#### Collections Framework

1. **Question: What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
   - **Answer:** `ArrayList` uses a dynamic array to store elements, providing fast random access but slow insertions and deletions. `LinkedList` uses a doubly linked list, providing fast insertions and deletions but slower random access.

2. **Question: How do you iterate over a `HashMap`?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
       System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
   }
   ```

#### Generics

1. **Question: What are the benefits of using generics in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Generics provide type safety, reduce the need for type casting, and allow for the creation of generic algorithms.

2. **Question: Write a generic method to find the maximum element in an array.**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T findMax(T[] array) {
       T max = array[0];
       for (T element : array) {
           if (element.compareTo(max) > 0) {
               max = element;
           }
       }
       return max;
   }
   ```

#### Threads and Concurrency

1. **Question: How do you create a thread in Java?**
   - **Answer:** By extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

2. **Question: What is the purpose of synchronization?**
   - **Answer:** Synchronization is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources, preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors.

#### I/O Streams

1. **Question: How do you read from a file in Java?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
   String line;
   while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       System.out.println(line);
   }
   reader.close();
   ```

2. **Question: What is serialization in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, so it can be easily saved to a file or transmitted over a network.

#### Networking

1. **Question: How do you create a server socket in Java?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(12345);
   Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
   ```

2. **Question: How do you connect to a server using a client socket?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 12345);
   ```

#### RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

1. **Question: What is RMI?**
   - **Answer:** RMI is a Java API that allows objects to communicate with each other in a distributed network.

2. **Question: How do you bind a remote object to the RMI registry?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   Naming.rebind("RemoteHello", remoteObject);
   ```

#### Lambdas and Streams (Java 8)

1. **Question: What is a lambda expression?**
   - **Answer:** A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed around as if it were an object.

2. **Question: How do you filter a list of strings to find only those that start with "A" using streams?**
   - **Answer:**
   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Anna");
   List<String> result = names.stream()
       .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
       .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```
