## Chapter 3: Know Your Variables: Primitives and References

#### Overview
- This chapter delves into the fundamental concepts of variables in Java, differentiating between primitive types and reference types.
- It covers the declaration, initialization, and usage of variables, providing a solid understanding of how memory is managed in Java.

### Key Concepts

1. **Variables in Java**
   - **Definition:** Containers for storing data values.
   - **Types:** Primitives and references.

2. **Primitive Data Types**
   - **Definition:** The most basic data types built into the Java language.
   - **Types and Sizes:**
     - `byte`: 8-bit integer
     - `short`: 16-bit integer
     - `int`: 32-bit integer
     - `long`: 64-bit integer
     - `float`: 32-bit floating-point
     - `double`: 64-bit floating-point
     - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character
     - `boolean`: true or false
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     int age = 25;
     char initial = 'A';
     boolean isStudent = true;
     ```

3. **Reference Variables**
   - **Definition:** Variables that hold references to objects, rather than the objects themselves.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     String name = "Alice";
     Dog myDog = new Dog();
     ```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Primitive Data Types in Detail**
   - **Byte:**
     - Range: -128 to 127
     - Example: `byte b = 10;`
   - **Short:**
     - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
     - Example: `short s = 1000;`
   - **Int:**
     - Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
     - Example: `int i = 100000;`
   - **Long:**
     - Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
     - Example: `long l = 100000L;`
   - **Float:**
     - Example: `float f = 10.5f;`
   - **Double:**
     - Example: `double d = 10.5;`
   - **Char:**
     - Example: `char c = 'A';`
   - **Boolean:**
     - Example: `boolean b = true;`

2. **Reference Variables in Detail**
   - **Definition:** Hold memory addresses where the actual objects are stored.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     String str = new String("Hello");
     Dog myDog = new Dog();
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - `str` references a `String` object in memory.
     - `myDog` references a `Dog` object in memory.

3. **Memory Management**
   - **Heap vs. Stack:**
     - **Heap:** Where objects are stored. Managed by the Garbage Collector.
     - **Stack:** Where primitive variables and references are stored. Manages method calls and local variables.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     int num = 5;
     Dog myDog = new Dog();
     ```
     - `num` is stored in the stack.
     - `myDog` reference is stored in the stack, and the actual `Dog` object is stored in the heap.

### Example Programs

1. **Primitive Variables Example**
   - **Source Code:**
     ```java
     public class PrimitivesExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             int age = 30;
             char grade = 'A';
             boolean isJavaFun = true;
             float price = 10.99f;
             double distance = 12345.6789;

             System.out.println("Age: " + age);
             System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
             System.out.println("Is Java Fun? " + isJavaFun);
             System.out.println("Price: " + price);
             System.out.println("Distance: " + distance);
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Age: 30
     Grade: A
     Is Java Fun? true
     Price: 10.99
     Distance: 12345.6789
     ```

2. **Reference Variables Example**
   - **Source Code:**
     ```java
     class Dog {
         String name;
         void bark() {
             System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
         }
     }

     public class ReferenceExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Dog myDog = new Dog();
             myDog.name = "Buddy";
             myDog.bark();
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Buddy says Woof!
     ```

### Key Differences Between Primitives and References

1. **Storage:**
   - **Primitives:** Stored directly in memory.
   - **References:** Store the memory address where the actual object is located.

2. **Default Values:**
   - **Primitives:** Have default values (e.g., 0 for numeric types, false for boolean).
   - **References:** Default to `null`.

3. **Assignment:**
   - **Primitives:** Directly assign the value.
   - **References:** Assign the memory address of the object.

### Scope and Lifetime

1. **Scope:**
   - **Local Variables:** Declared inside a method or block. Scope is limited to the method/block.
   - **Instance Variables:** Declared in a class but outside methods. Scope is the entire class.
   - **Class Variables (Static):** Declared with the `static` keyword. Scope is the entire class.

2. **Lifetime:**
   - **Local Variables:** Exist during the execution of the method/block.
   - **Instance Variables:** Exist as long as the object exists.
   - **Class Variables (Static):** Exist as long as the class is loaded in memory.

### Array Variables

1. **Definition:** Containers that hold a fixed number of values of a single type.
2. **Declaration and Initialization:**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     int[] numbers = new int[5];
     numbers[0] = 10;
     numbers[1] = 20;
     numbers[2] = 30;
     numbers[3] = 40;
     numbers[4] = 50;
     ```
   - **Alternative Initialization:**
     ```java
     int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
     ```
3. **Usage:**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     public class ArrayExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
             for (int num : numbers) {
                 System.out.println(num);
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     10
     20
     30
     40
     50
     ```

### Summary

- **Variables:** Understand the difference between primitive and reference variables.
- **Primitive Types:** Learn the eight primitive data types and their characteristics.
- **Reference Types:** Understand how reference variables work and how objects are stored in memory.
- **Memory Management:** Differentiate between stack and heap memory.
- **Scope and Lifetime:** Recognize the scope and lifetime of local, instance, and class variables.
- **Arrays:** Learn how to declare, initialize, and use arrays in Java.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Primitive Variables:** Store actual values, have default values, and are stored in the stack.
- **Reference Variables:** Store memory addresses of objects, default to null, and the actual objects are stored in the heap.
- **Memory Management:** Stack for method calls and local variables, heap for objects.
- **Arrays:** Fixed-size containers for values of a single type, declared and initialized in different ways.
