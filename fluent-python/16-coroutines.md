## Chapter 16: Coroutines

#### Overview
- This chapter explores coroutines in Python, explaining their use, how they differ from generators, and their practical applications.
- Coroutines are a powerful tool for asynchronous programming, allowing functions to yield control back to the event loop, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

### Key Concepts

1. **Generators vs. Coroutines**
   - **Generators:** Produce values and yield control back to the caller.
   - **Coroutines:** Can consume values and yield control back to the caller, typically used for cooperative multitasking.

2. **Defining Coroutines**
   - **Syntax:** Defined using `def` and `yield`, similar to generators.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def simple_coroutine():
         print('Coroutine started')
         x = yield
         print(f'Coroutine received: {x}')

     coro = simple_coroutine()
     next(coro)  # Output: Coroutine started
     coro.send(42)  # Output: Coroutine received: 42
     ```

3. **Advancing and Terminating Coroutines**
   - **`next()`:** Advances the coroutine to the first `yield`.
   - **`send(value)`:** Resumes the coroutine, sending a value to it.
   - **`close()`:** Terminates the coroutine.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def coroutine_example():
         try:
             while True:
                 x = yield
                 print(f'Received: {x}')
         except GeneratorExit:
             print('Coroutine closed')

     coro = coroutine_example()
     next(coro)
     coro.send(10)
     coro.close()  # Output: Coroutine closed
     ```

### Coroutine Basics

1. **Yielding Values**
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def echo_coroutine():
         while True:
             received = yield
             print(f'Echo: {received}')

     coro = echo_coroutine()
     next(coro)
     coro.send('Hello')  # Output: Echo: Hello
     coro.send('World')  # Output: Echo: World
     ```

2. **Coroutine Lifecycle**
   - **Stages:** Created, running, suspended, closed.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def coroutine_lifecycle():
         print('Coroutine started')
         yield
         print('Coroutine resumed')
         yield
         print('Coroutine ending')

     coro = coroutine_lifecycle()
     next(coro)  # Output: Coroutine started
     next(coro)  # Output: Coroutine resumed
     next(coro)  # Output: Coroutine ending
     ```

### Sending Values and Exceptions

1. **Sending Values**
   - **`send(value)`:** Sends a value to the coroutine, resuming its execution.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def sum_coroutine():
         total = 0
         while True:
             x = yield total
             total += x

     coro = sum_coroutine()
     next(coro)
     print(coro.send(10))  # Output: 10
     print(coro.send(20))  # Output: 30
     ```

2. **Throwing Exceptions**
   - **`throw(type, value=None, traceback=None)`:** Injects an exception into the coroutine.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def exception_coroutine():
         try:
             while True:
                 x = yield
                 print(f'Received: {x}')
         except ValueError:
             print('ValueError handled')

     coro = exception_coroutine()
     next(coro)
     coro.send(10)
     coro.throw(ValueError)  # Output: ValueError handled
     ```

### Coroutine Utilities

1. **Using `yield from`**
   - **Purpose:** Delegates part of the operations to another generator or coroutine.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def sub_coroutine():
         yield 1
         yield 2

     def main_coroutine():
         yield from sub_coroutine()
         yield 3

     for value in main_coroutine():
         print(value)
     # Output: 1 2 3
     ```

2. **Asynchronous Generators**
   - **Definition:** Combine the capabilities of coroutines and generators, allowing `yield` in async functions.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     async def async_generator():
         for i in range(3):
             yield i
             await asyncio.sleep(1)

     async def main():
         async for value in async_generator():
             print(value)

     asyncio.run(main())
     # Output: 0 1 2 (with 1-second intervals)
     ```

### Practical Applications

1. **Coroutines for Data Processing Pipelines**
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def data_pipeline():
         while True:
             data = yield
             print(f'Processing {data}')

     pipeline = data_pipeline()
     next(pipeline)
     pipeline.send('Item 1')
     pipeline.send('Item 2')
     ```

2. **Coroutines for Concurrent Tasks**
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def task(name, delay):
         await asyncio.sleep(delay)
         print(f'Task {name} completed')

     async def main():
         await asyncio.gather(
             task('A', 2),
             task('B', 1)
         )

     asyncio.run(main())
     # Output:
     # Task B completed
     # Task A completed
     ```

3. **Coroutines with `asyncio` for Asynchronous Programming**
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def fetch_data():
         print('Fetching data...')
         await asyncio.sleep(2)
         return {'data': 123}

     async def main():
         result = await fetch_data()
         print(result)

     asyncio.run(main())
     # Output:
     # Fetching data...
     # {'data': 123}
     ```
